      <description>Question 1 An online hypermarket company has deployed a web application using a REST API with Amazon API Gateway. Recently, they upgraded the backend to make the API scalable. After the upgrade, it was discovered that some consumers using older methods could no longer access the API, as the older method is not compatible with the responses from the backend.
How should a solutions architect redesign the API Gateway to ensure compatibility with the old method?</description>
