		<h4 id="question-1">Question 1</h4>
<p>You have implemented AWS Cognito services to require users to sign in and sign up to your app
through social identity providers like Facebook, Google, etc. Your marketing department wants users
to anonymously try out the app because the current log-in requirement is excessive, which may reduce
the demand for products and services offered through the app. What would you suggest to the
marketing department in this regard?</p>
<p>A.
It’s too much of a security risk to allow unauthenticated users access to the app.</p>
<p>B.
Cognito Identity supports guest users for the ability to enter the app and have limited access.</p>
<p>C.
A second version of the app will need to be offered for unauthenticated users.</p>
<p>D.
This is possible only if we remove the authentication from everywhere</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - B <br />

- Option B is correct. Amazon Cognito Identity Pools can support unauthenticated identities by
  providing a unique identifier and AWS credentials for users who do not authenticate with an
  identity
  provider. Unauthenticated users can be associated with a role with limited access to resources
  compared to a role for authenticated users. <br />
- Option A is incorrect. Cognito will allow unauthenticated users without being a security
  risk. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. Cognito supports both authenticated and unauthenticated users. <br />

<h4 id="question-2">Question 2</h4>
<p>Your app uses AWS Cognito Identity for authentication and stores user profiles in a User Pool. To
expand the availability and ease of signing in to the app, your team is requesting advice on
allowing the use of OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers as additional means of authenticating
users and saving the user profile information. What is your recommendation on OIDC identity
providers?</p>
<p>A.
This is supported, along with social and SAML based identity providers.</p>
<p>B.
This is not supported, only social identity providers can be integrated into User Pools</p>
<p>C.
If you want OIDC identity providers, then you must include SAML and social-based support as well</p>
<p>D.
It’s too much effort to add non-Cognito authenticated user information to a User Pool</p>

    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - A <br />

- Option A is correct. OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdPs) (like Salesforce or Ping
  Identity) are supported in Cognito, along with social and SAML based identity providers. You can
  add
  an OIDC IdP to your user pool in the AWS Management Console, with the AWS CLI, or with the user
  pool
  API method CreateIdentityProvider. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Cognito supports more than just social identity providers, including OIDC,
  SAML, and its own identity pools. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. You can add any combination of federated types. You don’t have to add them
  all. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. While there is additional coding to develop this, the effort is most likely
  not too great to add the feature. <br />

<p>Your company currently has a web distribution hosted using the AWS CloudFront service. The IT
Security department has confirmed that the application using this web distribution now falls under
the scope of PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance. What are the necessary steps to be followed
before auditing? (SELECT TWO)</p>
<p>A.
Enable CloudFront access logs.</p>
<p>B.
Enable Cache in CloudFront.</p>
<p>C.
Use AWS CloudTrail to capture requests sent to the CloudFront API.</p>
<p>D.
Enable VPC Flow Logs</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A and C <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

If you run PCI or HIPAA-compliant workloads based on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, we
recommend that you log your CloudFront usage data for the last 365 days for future auditing
purposes. <br />

To log usage data, you can perform the following: <br />

Enable CloudFront access logs. <br />
Capture requests that are sent to the CloudFront API using AWS CloudTrail. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because enabling cache will only reduce latency. It will not help to fulfill
  the requirement provided in the question. <br />

- Option D is incorrect. VPC flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from
  network interfaces in a VPC, not for CloudFront.

<h4 id="question-4">Question 4</h4>
<p>A company has applications running in multiple VPCs. These applications require interaction between
Amazon S3 buckets and DynamoDB. The company&rsquo;s security policy requires that communication should be
secure and should not go over the public internet.</p>
<p>How does a solutions architect design this solution to meet these requirements?</p>
<p>A.
Create VPC Gateway Endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB and update route tables for all the availability
zones.</p>
<p>B.
Use the NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway for all the egress communication to these AWS services.</p>
<p>C.
Set up VPC peering and use VPC gateway endpoint for S3 and interface endpoint for DynamoDB to
communicate over AWS network.</p>
<p>D.
Set up VPC Peering between all VPCs and use public endpoints for both S3 and DynamoDB to facilitate
communication over the AWS network.</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: A <br />

Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 <br />
You can use two types of VPC endpoints to access Amazon S3: gateway endpoints and interface
endpoints. A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify in your route table to access Amazon S3
from your VPC over the AWS network. Interface endpoints extend the functionality of gateway
endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC,
on-premises, or from a VPC in another AWS Region using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5_img_1.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5" loading="lazy"><br />

There are two types of VPC endpoints: <br />

Interface endpoint is an elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP address from the IP
address range of the user's subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported
service. It enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses. <br />

Gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for
traffic destined to support AWS service. Currently supports S3 and DynamoDB services. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because the VPC gateway endpoint supports S3 and DynamoDB. Using the VPC
  endpoint, communication will not go over the internet, and it will use AWS private network. A VPC
  endpoint does not require an IGW, NAT device. Instances in the VPC do not require public IP
  addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between VPC and the other service
  stays in the Amazon network. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as NAT gateway and IGW use public internet and do not provide secure
  channels. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as DynamoDB can be accessed using Gateway endpoint and not interface
  endpoint.
  VPC peering is between VPCs. <br />
- Option D is incorrect This option is incorrect because it suggests using public endpoints for both
  Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. While VPC peering allows communication between VPCs, using public
  endpoints
  would route traffic over the internet, which does not meet the company's security policy that
  requires secure communication without going over the public internet. Both services should utilize
  their respective private endpoints (Gateway for S3 and Interface for DynamoDB) to ensure the
  communication remains within AWS's private network. <br />

<h4 id="question-5">Question 5</h4>
<p>A company consists of 50 plus AWS accounts. Each account has multiple VPCs with egress internet
connectivity using NAT gateway per Availability Zone (AZ). A solution architect has been asked to
redesign the network architecture that will reduce costs, and manage egress traffic, and the growing
needs of new accounts.</p>
<p>Which solution meets the requirements?</p>
<p>A.
Create an egress VPC for outbound internet traffic. Use VPC peering between AWS accounts&rsquo; VPCs and
connect to a set of redundant NAT gateways in the egress VPC.</p>
<p>B.
Create a Transit Gateway in one central AWS account that will work as a hub and spoke model to other
accounts VPCs using VPC attachments. Setup an egress VPC for egress traffic with redundant Nat
Gateways.</p>
<p>C.
Create an egress VPC for outbound internet traffic. Use AWS Private links between AWS accounts&rsquo; VPCs
and connect to a set of redundant NAT gateways in the egress VPC.</p>
<p>D.
Create a Transit Gateway in one central AWS account that will work as a hub and spoke model to other
accounts VPCs using VPN attachments. Set up a Central VPC for egress traffic with redundant Nat
Gateways</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: B <br />

This architecture shows AWS Transit Gateway to centralize outbound internet traffic from multiple
VPCs using a hub-and-spoke design. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5_img_2.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect because VPC peering doesn’t support transitive routing between Account A VPC
  to Account B VPC to egress the internet. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because this design supports transitive routing and centralizing egress, which
  helps to reduce cost. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because AWS Private Link doesn’t support NAT devices. <br />
- Option D is incorrect This option proposes using VPN attachments for the Transit Gateway. VPNs are
  not necessary for connecting VPCs within the same AWS environment and may introduce additional
  costs
  and complexity without providing the required benefits for egress traffic management. <br />
  AWS PrivateLink enables you to securely connect your VPCs to supported AWS services: to your own
  services on AWS, to services hosted by other AWS accounts, and to third-party services on AWS
  Marketplace. Since traffic between your VPC and any one of these services does not leave the
  Amazon
  network, an Internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, or VPN connection is no longer needed
  to communicate with the service. <br />

<p>Your organization must perform big data analysis to transform data and store the result in the AWS
S3 bucket. They have implemented the solution using AWS Lambda due to its zero-administrative
maintenance and cost-effective nature. However, in very few cases, the execution is getting abruptly
terminated after 15 minutes. They would like to get a notification in such scenarios. What would you
do?</p>
<p>A.
Setup timer in the code and send a notification when the timer reaches 900 seconds.</p>
<p>B.
Configure SES for failures under the Configuration option in the lambda function.</p>
<p>C.
Setup the ERROR_NOTIFY environment variable with an email address. Lambda function has an inbuilt
feature to send an email during max memory and time out terminations using this environment
variable.</p>
<p>D.
Configure Dead-letter Queue and send a notification to SNS topic</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: D <br />

- Option A is not correct. Although you can set the timers in the code, it may not be an accurate
  measure to determine if the lambda function is terminated after 900 seconds or just finished
  executing on the 900th second. <br />

- Option B is not correct. There is no option to configure AWS SES within the Lambda setup. <br />

- Option C is not a valid statement. <br />

- Option D is correct. You can forward non-processed payloads to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) using AWS
  SQS, AWS SNS. <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

There are multiple approaches to secure the AWS DMS resources. Details can be found in <br />

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect: TLS protects the network layer. However, it does not assign
  permissions. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: KMS encrypts data. But it cannot manage the permissions. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT: Because IAM policies can be assigned to IAM users who need to manage DMS
  resources. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: NCL acts as a firewall to protect the VPC subnets. But it does not
  determine
  who can access DMS resources. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

AWS DataSync should be selected to simplify moving data between on-premises storage and AWS services
such as S3 Glacier. Check
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/what-is-datasync.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/what-is-datasync.html</a> <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: With AWS DataSync, users can create a task to specify the data source and
  destination and then configure the data transfer. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because Server Migration Service is used to migrate on-premise servers such
  as VMware. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Database Migration Service is used to migrate a database instead of local
  storage. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Direct Connect sets up a dedicated network connection to AWS. However, it
  does not automate the data transfer to AWS. <br />

AWS has provided several connectivity options, according to
<a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.pdf" target="_blank">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.pdf</a>
VPN is needed as it creates an IPsec connection. AWS Direct Connect is also required because it
establishes a private connection with high bandwidth throughput. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: Because with AWS Direct Connect + VPN, you can create IPsec-encrypted private

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answers – B, C, and D <br />

When a user performs a DELETE operation on an object, subsequent simple (un-versioned) requests will
no longer retrieve the object. However, all versions of that object will continue to be preserved in
your Amazon S3 bucket and can be retrieved or restored. <br />

Versioning’s MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide
an additional layer of security. By default, all requests to your Amazon S3 bucket require your AWS
account credentials. If you enable Versioning with MFA Delete on your Amazon S3 bucket, two forms of
authentication are required to permanently delete a version of an object: your AWS account
credentials and valid six-digit code and serial number from an authentication device in your
physical possession. <br />

- Option D is correct. Writing IAM user policies that specify the users that can access specific
  buckets and objects. IAM policies provide a programmatic way to manage Amazon S3 permissions for
  multiple users. <br />

- Option A is incorrect, Enable encryption for the S3 bucket is incorrect because encryption
  primarily
  protects data at rest by ensuring that the data is unreadable to unauthorized users. However, it
  does not prevent accidental deletion of objects. Encryption focuses on data confidentiality rather
  than access control or deletion prevention <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - A <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following. <br />

Regardless of whether you enable automated snapshots, you can take a manual snapshot whenever you
want at any time. By default, manual snapshots are retained indefinitely, even after you delete your
cluster. You can specify the retention period when you create a manual snapshot or change the
retention period by modifying the snapshot. <br />

To reduce cost, we can delete the manual snapshots that are taken, if any. <br />

Backup storage is the storage associated with the snapshots taken for your data warehouse.
Increasing your backup retention period or taking additional snapshots increases the backup storage
consumed by your data warehouse. <br />

For example, if your RA3 cluster has 10 TB of data and 30 TB of manual snapshots, you would be
billed for 10 TB of RMS and 30 TB of backup storage. With dense compute (DC) and dense storage (DS)
clusters, storage is included on the cluster and is not billed separately, but backups are stored
externally in Amazon S3. Backup storage beyond the provisioned storage size on DC and DS clusters is
billed as backup storage at standard S3 rates. Snapshots are billed until they expire or are
deleted, including when the cluster is paused or deleted. <br />
Automated snapshots are automatically deleted within the period of 1(Least) to 35(Max) days (Based
on the retention period settings). So we have to take care of the Manual snapshots instead of
Automated snapshots. Amazon Redshift never deletes Manual snapshots automatically, as how it does
for Automatic Snapshots. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because the Automated snapshots are automatically deleted within the period
  of
  1(Least) to 35(Max) days. This will NOT have any impact on the cost <br />

- Option C is incorrect because SPOT instances are not a good fit for snapshots and the question
  does
  not mention one of these. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because instance store volumes are volatile and therefore this is NOT a good
  fit for the snapshot. <br />

Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option C is correct. Using the elastic load balancer to perform health checks will determine
  whether
  or not to remove a non-performing or underperforming instance, and have the auto-scaling group
  launch a new instance. <br />
- Option A is incorrect. Increasing the instance size doesn’t prevent the failure of one or both
  instances. Therefore the website can still become slow or unavailable. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Monitoring the VPC flow logs for the VPC will capture the VPC traffic, not
  the traffic for the EC2 instance. You would need to create a flow log for a network
  interface. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Replicating the same two instance deployment may not prevent instances of
  failure and could still result in the website becoming slow or unavailable. <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

AWS Storage Gateway connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide
seamless integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and the AWS
storage infrastructure. You can use the service to store data in the AWS Cloud for scalable and
cost-effective storage to maintain data security. <br />

It has two types of configuration, cached volumes and stored volumes: <br />

We require to start storing backups of the on-premises data to AWS. <br />

In cached volumes, you store your data in S3 and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets
locally. It means that we are not storing the backups on S3 but the actual primary data
itself. <br />

But in the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally, and your entire dataset is available
for low-latency access on-premises while asynchronously getting backed up to AWS S3. <br />

- Option A is Incorrect, While Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes can be created and used to
  store data, they are designed primarily for use with EC2 instances. They do not inherently provide
  a
  backup solution for on-premises data nor low-latency access to that data if the data needs to be
  transferred from on-premises systems. It also does not address backup or hybrid cloud use cases
  effectively. <br />

- Option B is Incorrect, EBS Snapshots are a way to create backups of EBS volumes. However, they are
  typically used to back up the data stored in EBS volumes rather than acting as a direct method to
  back up on-premises data. Snapshots are also not designed for low-latency access from on-premises
  data and are more suited for backup and recovery of EC2 instance data. <br />

- Option D is Incorrect, Amazon Glacier is primarily designed for long-term archival storage and is
  not suitable for low-latency access. Although it is cost-effective for storing large amounts of
  data, the retrieval times can vary from minutes to hours, making it impractical for scenarios that
  require quick access to data. Thus, it doesn't meet the requirement for low-latency access. <br />

  not a serverless service. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because both API Gateway/Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB are serverless, and hence
  the process of deploying servers is simplified. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

Compute Savings Plans offer the most flexibility, allowing cost savings across different EC2
instance families, sizes, and AWS services. This is ideal for the web tier, which may run on
different EC2 types. <br />

EC2 Instance Savings Plans are more restrictive but provide better discounts for a specific instance
type. These are a good fit for the application tier, where the architecture is more stable and uses
a specific EC2 instance family. <br />

Reserved Instances (RIs) are ideal for RDS (database tier), as databases often have long-term,
predictable usage. Reserved Instances offer substantial cost savings over On-Demand pricing and
ensure high availability and reliability. <br />

- Option B is incorrect Using EC2 Instance Savings Plans for the database tier is less effective
  than
  Reserved Instances for RDS. Reserved Instances are specifically optimized for databases and offer
  better savings. <br />
- Option C is incorrect Compute Savings Plans for the application tier and database tier are not as
  cost-effective as EC2 Instance Savings Plans and Reserved Instances for these tiers, given their
  predictable workloads. <br />
- Option D is incorrect On-Demand Instances for the database tier significantly increase costs
  compared to Reserved Instances, which are more suitable for consistent workloads. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache
Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. Using these frameworks
and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, you can process data for
analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to
transform and move a large amount of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases, such
as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB. <br />

Options B and C are incorrect as it would be an overhead for EC2 Instances to process log files when
you already have a ready-made service to help in this regard. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because DynamoDB is not an ideal option to store log files. <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following on Lifecycle Policies. <br />

Lifecycle configuration enables you to specify the lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. The
configuration is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to
apply to a group of objects. These actions can be classified as follows. <br />

Transition actions – In which you define when objects transition occurs to another storage class.
For example, you may choose transition objects to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent access)
storage class 30 days after creation or archive objects to the GLACIER storage class one year after
creation. <br />
Expiration actions – In which you specify when the objects expire. Then Amazon S3 deletes the
expired objects on your behalf. <br />

Correct Answer: D <br />

To determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered it,
you can use CloudTrail log file integrity validation. This feature is built using industry-standard
algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing. This makes it
computationally infeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail log files without detection. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as, by default, all CloudTrail log files are delivered to S3 buckets using
  SSE-S3 encryption. This will not ensure the integrity of log files. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as with Amazon SSE-KMS encryption for CloudTrail log files. There would be
  an
  additional layer of security for log files. But it won’t ensure the integrity of log files. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as this will restrict access to the bucket. But it won’t ensure that no
  modification has been done to log files post delivering in S3 buckets. <br />

We designed IAM roles so that your applications can securely make API requests from your instances,
without requiring you to manage the security credentials that the applications use. Instead of
creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make API requests
using IAM roles as follows: <br />

Create an IAM role. <br />

Define which accounts or AWS services can assume the role. <br />

Define which API actions and resources the application can use after assuming the role. <br />

Specify the role when you launch your instance or attach the role to an existing instance. <br />

Have the application retrieve a set of temporary credentials and use them. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

The question asks for the NACL rule when the instances and transit gateway are in different subnets
and traffic flows from EC2 instance to transit gateway. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. For traffic outbound from your EC2 instance subnet, the source IP address
  is
  not valid, the destination IP address is used to evaluate the rule. <br />
- Option B is correct. This is the required rule NACLs should follow when the instances and transit
  gateway are in different subnets and the traffic flows from instances to the transit
  gateway. <br />
  Network ACL Outbound rules use the destination IP address to evaluate traffic from the instances
  to
  the transit gateway. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because when the instances and transit gateway are in different subnets,
  outbound rules are evaluated and provide the flow of traffic as required.   <br />
- Option D is incorrect. For traffic inbound from your transit gateway, the source IP address is
  used
  to evaluate the rule. <br />

Explanation: Adding Lifecycle Hooks to the Auto Scaling group puts the instance into a wait state
before termination. During this wait state, you can perform custom activities to retrieve critical
operational data from a stateful instance. The Default Wait period is 1 hour. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5_img_7.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect as the cooldown period will not help copy data from the instance before
  termination. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as the Termination policy is used to specify which instances to terminate
  first during scale-in. Configuring termination policy for the Auto Scaling group will not copy
  data
  before instance termination.   <br />

Option D- US West 2a-6 , US West 2b - 6, US West 2c-0 <br />

If US West 2a goes down, we will still have 6 instances running in US West 2b. <br />
If US West 2b goes down, we will still have 6 instances running in US West 2a. <br />
If US West 2c goes down, we will still have 6 instances running in US West 2a, 6 instances running
in US West 2b. <br />

Option E- US West 2a-3 , US West 2b - 3, US West 2c-3 <br />

If US West 2a goes down, we will still have 3 instances running in US West 2b and 3 instances
running in US West 2c. <br />
If US West 2b goes down, we will still have 3 instances running in US West 2a and 3 instances
running in US West 2c. <br />
If US West 2c goes down, we will still have 3 instances running in US West 2a and 3 instances

You can first create a Lambda function with the code to process the file. <br />

Then, you can use an Event Notification from the S3 bucket to invoke the Lambda function whenever a
file is uploaded. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Kinesis is used to collect, process, and analyze real-time data. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as SQS cannot store a message that is 3GB. The maximum payload supported by
  SQS is 2GB. <br />
  To manage large Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) messages, you can use Amazon Simple
  Storage
  Service (Amazon S3) and the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java. This is especially useful
  for storing and consuming messages up to 2 GB. <br />

- Option C is incorrect as EBS is a service to provide block-level storage. S3 is more suitable in
  this scenario. <br />

Note: The total volume of data and the number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual
Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. The
largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. <br />

<p>You are part of an IT team who have created a streaming application. The application is hosted in
two separate regions, us-east-1(N Virginia) and ap-south-1 (Mumbai). Your application recently
became very popular, and now has users from all around the world. However, these new users have been
experiencing high latency in the application. How can you solve this problem, keeping in mind that
possible failovers in the app need to be solved very quickly?</p>
<p>A.
Enable a DNS-based traffic management solution with Geolocation route policies in Route53.</p>
<p>B.
Enable AWS WAF to securely serve your application content to the nearest Edge Locations to the

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because if there is a failover, you will need to modify the source
  application's IP address or configure Route53 records. That will take time to solve the
  failover. <br />
  More details please check
  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geo</a>
- Option B is incorrect because AWS WAF is a service to protect applications from attacks. It does
  not
  help to improve the performance or reduce latency. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT because AWS Global Accelerator is a service that redirects users requests to
  the
  nearest edge location and then routes the data to the Amazon global network, increasing the speed
  and security of data transfer, therefore, increasing the performance of our applications. It also
  reroutes requests to healthy IPs if it fails and changes propagations. It is automatic and lasts
  some seconds. <br />
  More details please check
  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/</a>

  Here is the additional explanation on AWS website on Global accelerator FAQ. Why DNS/Route 53 is
  an
  inferior option as compared to Global accelerator. <br />

Q: How is AWS Global Accelerator different from a DNS-based traffic management solution? <br />

A: First, some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods of time. So
when you make a configuration update, or there’s an application failure or change in your routing
preference, you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP
addresses. With AWS Global Accelerator, you don’t have to rely on the IP address caching settings of
client devices. Change propagation takes a matter of seconds, which reduces your application
downtime. Second, with Global Accelerator, you get static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry
point to your applications. This lets you easily move your endpoints between Availability Zones or
between AWS Regions, without having to update the DNS configuration or client-facing
applications. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address with which you can mask the
  failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your
  account. <br />
  If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with
  your instance to enable communication with the internet; for example, to connect to your instance
  from your local computer. <br />

From our problem statement, EC2 is launched with Auto-assign public IP enabled. So, since public IP
is available, Elastic IP is not necessary to connect from the internet. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because the problem statement clearly states that EC2 is launched with
  Auto-assign Public IP enabled, so this option cannot be true. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT as the NCL may not allow the ingress SSH traffic so the connection failed to
  connect. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because SSH uses port 22. A security group is stateful and in this scenario,
  the security group may disallow the ingress SSH traffic instead of egress. <br />

    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer – B <br />

The volume data is used infrequently, not throughout the day, and the question requires the MOST
cost-effective storage type. So the preferred choice would be Amazon Cold HDD. Cold HDD is suitable
for the following scenarios: <br />

Throughput-oriented storage for data that is infrequently accessed. <br />

Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important. <br />

The volume size of EBS Cold HDD is 125 GiB - 16 TiB. The database size is 150G and is suitable in
this scenario. <br />

Options A and C are incorrect as 'Provisioned IOPS SSD' and 'General Purpose SSD' are not
cost-efficient. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because EFS is file storage, not block or volume storage. Hence not suitable
  for the given requirement <br />

Note: IOPS measures the number of reads and writes operations per second, while throughput measures
the number of bits reads or written per second. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – D <br />

Auto Scaling group supports a mix of On-Demand & Spot instances, which helps design a cost-optimized
solution without impacting the performance. You can choose the percentage of On-Demand & Spot
instances based on the application requirements. With Option D, the Auto Scaling group will have 2
instances initially as the On-Demand instances. In contrast, the remaining instances will be
launched in a 20 % On-Demand instance & 80% Spot Instance ratio. <br />

No matter, if 80% of spot instances get terminated. The required 20% on-demand will be available
with 2 on-demand instances always running. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. With t2. Micro, there would be a cost reduction, but it will impact the
  performance of the application. The question requires that the performance is not impacted, so
  changing the instance type is not suitable. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as there would not be any cost reduction with all On-Demand
  instances. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. Although this will reduce cost, all spot instances in an auto-scaling group
  may cause inconsistencies in the application & lead to poor performance. <br />

Correct Answer – D <br />

External users will be unable to access the instance in private subnets directly. To provide such
access, we need to deploy Bastion hosts in public subnets. In case of the above requirement,
third-party users will initiate a connection to Bastion hosts in public subnets & from there, they
will access SSH connection to database servers in private subnets. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Bastion hosts need to be in Public subnets & not in Private subnets, as
  third-party users will be accessing these servers from the internet. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as NAT instance is used to provide internet traffic to hosts in private
  subnets. Users from the internet will not be able to do SSH connections to hosts in private
  subnets
  using NAT instance. NAT instance is always present in Public subnets. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as NAT instance is used to provide internet traffic to hosts in private
  subnets. Users from the internet will not be able to do SSH connections to hosts in private
  subnets
  using NAT instance. <br />
- Option B and C (Deploy NAT Instance in Private/Public Subnet) are used to provide internet access
  for outbound traffic from instances in private subnets but do not help with secure inbound access
  to
  the database servers via SSH. <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection can be used to detect changes made to AWS resources outside the
CloudFormation Templates. AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection only checks property values explicitly
set by stack templates or by specifying template parameters. It does not determine drift for
property values that are set by default. To determine drift for these resources, you can explicitly
set property values that can be the same as that of the default value. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. If property values are assigned explicitly to these properties, running AWS
  CloudFormation Drift Detection would be detected in both individuals and the entire CloudFormation
  Stack. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as CloudFormation Drift Detection supports the AWS EC2 instance. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Since for all other resources, CloudFormation Drift Detection has already
  determined drift, there is no other read permission to be granted further. <br />

Correct Answer – B and C <br />

This sort of setup is explained in the AWS documentation. <br />

1) To ensure that traffic can flow into your webserver from anywhere on secure traffic, you need to
   allow inbound security at 443. <br />

2) And then, you need to ensure that traffic can flow from the webserver to the database server via
   the database security group. <br />

The below snapshots from the AWS Documentation show rule tables for security groups related to the
same requirements as in the question. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5_img_12.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5" loading="lazy"><br />

Options A and D are incorrect. Network ACLs are stateless. So we need to set rules for both inbound
and outbound traffic for Network ACLs. <br />

- Option E is incorrect because, in order to communicate with the MySQL servers, we need to allow
  traffic to flow through port 3306. <br />

Note: The above correct options are the combination of steps required to secure your web and
database servers. Besides, the company may implement additional security measures from their
end. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – B <br />

- Option A is incorrect since the records need to be stored in a highly scalable system. <br />
- Option C is incorrect since the records must be available for immediate download. <br />
- Option D is incorrect since EFS lifecycle management is used to migrate files that have not been
  accessed for a certain period of time to the Infrequent Access storage class. Files moved to this
  storage remain indefinitely and not get deleted. And due to this reason, this option is not
  correct. <br />
  AWS Documentation mentions the following about Lifecycle Policies: <br />

Lifecycle configuration enables you to specify the Lifecycle Management of objects in a bucket. The
configuration is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to
apply to a group of objects. These actions can be classified as follows: <br />

Transition actions – In which you define when the transition of the object occurs to another storage
class. For example, you may choose to transition objects to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent
access) storage class 30 days after creation or archive objects to the GLACIER storage class one
year after creation. <br />

Expiration actions – In which you specify when the objects will expire. Then Amazon S3 deletes the
expired objects on your behalf. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - B <br />

AWS CloudFormation enables consultants to use their architecture diagrams to construct
CloudFormation templates. <br />

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Service resources.
You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances
or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those
resources for you. <br />

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and
services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js etc. <br />

Options C and D are incorrect because Code Build and Code Deploy do not provision or configure
resources automatically via a template. <br />

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs
tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. <br />

AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2
instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services. <br />

<p>You have developed a new web application on AWS for a real estate firm. It has a web interface where
real estate employees upload photos of newly constructed houses in S3 buckets. Prospective buyers
log in to the website and access photos. The marketing team has initiated an intensive marketing
event to promote new housing schemes which will lead to customers who frequently access these
images. As this is a new application, you have no projection of traffic on the S3 bucket. You need
an S3 storage class that can automatically optimize the storage costs with changing access patterns.
Which of the following is a recommended storage solution to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Use One Zone-IA storage class to store all images.</p>
<p>B.
Use Standard-IA to store all images.</p>
<p>C.
Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p>
<p>D.
Use Standard storage class and use Storage class analytics to identify &amp; move objects using

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – C <br />

When the access pattern to web applications using S3 storage buckets is unpredictable, you can use
S3 intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class includes two access
tiers: frequent access and infrequent access. Based upon access patterns, it moves data between
these tiers, which helps in cost saving. S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class has the same
performance as that of Standard storage class. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Although it will save costs, it will not provide any protection in case of
  AZ
  failure. Also, this class is suitable for infrequently accessed data & not for frequently access
  data. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as Standard-IA storage class is for infrequently accessed data & there are
  retrieval charges associated. In the above requirement, you do not know the data access pattern,
  which may result in a higher cost. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. It has operational overhead to set up Storage class analytics & moves
  objects
  between various classes. Also, since the access pattern is undetermined, this will run into a
  costlier option. <br />

Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Partition Placement Groups distribute the instances in different
  partitions.
  The partitions are placed in the same AZ, but do not share the same rack. This type of placement
  group does not provide low latency throughput to the instances. More details- <br />

Amazon Elastic Transcoder is the correct option for this scenario. It is a scalable media
transcoding service that automatically converts media files into formats suitable for various
devices, making it ideal for efficiently delivering media content across different platforms. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Video Streams is designed for securely capturing,
  processing, and storing video streams for analytics and machine learning. It is not suitable for
  media transcoding tasks like converting media files into different formats. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because AWS IoT Core provides communication and management capabilities for
  IoT devices, enabling secure connectivity and data exchange between devices and the cloud. It is
  not
  intended for media transcoding tasks. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because AWS IoT Greengrass extends IoT functionality to edge devices,

In this question, a Windows file server is required in AWS, and the application should continue to
work unchanged. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is the correct answer as it is backed by a fully
native Windows file system. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon WorkSpace configures a desktop server which is not required
  in
  this question. Only a Windows file server is needed. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because EFS cannot be used to configure a Windows file server. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT because Amazon FSx provides fully managed Microsoft Windows file servers.

Correct Answer – B <br />

The AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and
from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. After
you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because AWS Trusted Advisor is your customized cloud expert! It helps you to
  observe the best practices for using AWS by inspecting your AWS environment to save money, improve
  system performance and reliability, and close security gaps. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because CloudWatch Metric is mainly used for performance metrics and cannot
  provide the source IP addresses. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance,
  operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log,
  continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS
  infrastructure.
  However, it is costly to use a CloudTrail. <br />

The Lustre file system is an open-source, parallel file system that can be used for HPC
applications. Refer to<a href="http://lustre.org/" target="_blank">http://lustre.org/ </a>
for its introduction. In Amazon FSx, users can quickly launch a Lustre file system at a low
cost. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: Amazon FSx supports Lustre file systems, and users pay for only the resources
  they use. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Although users may be able to configure a Lustre file system through EBS,
  it
  needs lots of extra configurations. - Option A is more straightforward. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because the EC2 placement group does not support a Lustre file
  system. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because products in AWS Marketplace are not cost-effective. For Amazon FSx,
  there are no minimum fees or set-up charges. Check its pricing in

<h4 id="question-51">Question 51</h4>
<p>An EC2 instance in the private subnet needs access to the S3 bucket placed in the same region as
that of the EC2 instance. The EC2 instance needs to upload and download bigger files to the S3
bucket frequently.</p>
<p>As an AWS Solutions Architect, what quick and cost-effective solution would you suggest to your
customers? You need to consider that the EC2 instances are present in the private subnet, and the
customers do not want their data to be exposed over the internet.</p>
<p>A.
Place the S3 bucket in another public subnet of the same region and create a VPC peering connection
to this private subnet where the EC2 instance is placed. The traffic to upload and download files
will go through secure Amazon&rsquo;s private network.</p>
<p>B.
Create an IAM role having access over the S3 service and assign it to the EC2 instance.</p>
<p>C.
Create a VPC endpoint for S3, use your route tables to control which instances can access resources
in Amazon S3 via the endpoint. The traffic to upload and download files will go through the Amazon
private network.</p>
<p>D.
A private subnet can always access S3 bucket/ service through the NAT Gateways or NAT instances, so
there is no need for additional setup.</p>

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the S3 service is region-specific, not AZ’s specific, and the
  statement talks about placing the S3 bucket in Public Subnet. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the VPC endpoint has a policy that controls the use of the endpoint
  to
  access Amazon S3 resources. The default policy allows access by any user or service within the
  VPC,
  using credentials from any AWS account to any Amazon S3 resource. (Creating an IAM role) grants
  permissions but does not solve the network routing issue for instances in a private subnet. The
  IAM
  role alone won't enable access to S3 without proper network configuration. <br />
- Option C is correct. It can help to access the S3 services in the same region for the EC2
  instance.
  You can create a VPC endpoint and update the route entry of the route table associated with the
  private subnet. This is a quick solution as well as cost-effective as it will use Amazon's own
  private network. Hence, it won’t expose the data over the internet. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as this is certainly not a default setup unless we create a NAT Gateway or
  Instance. Even if they are there, it’s an expensive solution and exposes the data over the
  internet. <br />

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route
traffic between them privately. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they

CloudFront can store the frequently accessed content as a cache, and the performance is optimized.
Other options may help with the performance. However, they do not store cache for the S3

Correct Answer – C <br />

Since there is only one NAT Gateway, this is a bottleneck in the architecture. For high
availability, launch NAT Gateways in multiple Available Zones. <br />

If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT
gateway’s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access.
To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability
Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same
Availability Zone. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - B <br />

This scenario is not about automation (although it can indeed be automated) but extending resiliency
through a backup strategy. There is no access to the bucket where snapshots are automatically backed
upon and that is why cross-region replication is not an option in this context. <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

With Amazon EBS, you can create point-in-time snapshots of volumes, which we store for you in Amazon
S3. After you create a snapshot and it has finished copying to Amazon S3 (when the snapshot status
is
<strong>completed</strong>
), you can copy it from one AWS Region to another, or within the same Region. <br />

For more information on EBS Snapshots, please visit the following URL: <br />

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html</a> <br />

For more information on Restoring an Amazon EBS Volume from a Snapshot, please visit the following
URL: <br />

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html</a> <br />

- Option C is incorrect because we can't directly use Cross-region replication. It requires a
  replication configuration for the source bucket. EBS snapshots are stored in S3, which is managed
  by
  AWS. We don't have the option to see the snapshots in S3. <br />

S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS
Regions. <br />

For CRR, there is a requirement to add replication configuration to your source bucket and nothing
is mentioned about the source or destination bucket in the requirement. <br />
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html</a> <br />

  CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch are different. <br />
  Amazon CloudWatch Logs are used to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic

- Option A is wrong because ELB can only balance traffic in one region, not across multiple
  regions. <br />
  Options B and C are incorrect because using backups across AZs is not enough for disaster recovery

option from the list given here. Out of this, the most suitable one is Option D. <br />
Most organizations try to implement High Availability (HA) instead of DR to guard them against any
downtime of services. In the case of HA, we ensure that there exists a fallback mechanism for our
services. The service that runs in HA is handled by hosts running in different availability zones
but the same geographical region. However, this approach does not guarantee that our business will
be up and running in case the entire region goes down. <br />

DR takes things to a completely new level, wherein you need to recover from a different region that
is separated by over 250 miles. Our DR implementation is an Active/Passive model, meaning that we
always have minimum critical services running in different regions. But a major part of the
infrastructure is launched and restored when required. <br />

For more information on large scale disaster recovery using AWS regions, please visit the following
URL: <br />

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/large-scale-disaster-recovery-using-aws-regions/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/large-scale-disaster-recovery-using-aws-regions/</a> <br />

Note: <br />
Usually, when we discuss a disaster recovery scenario, we assume that the entire region is affected
due to some disaster. So we need the service to be provided from yet another region. So, setting up
a solution in another AZ will not work as it is in the same region. - Option A is incorrect though
it
mentions yet another region because ELBs cannot span across regions. <br />

So out of the options provided, - Option D is the most suitable solution. <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

ElastiCache is an in-memory solution that can be used in front of a database to cache the common
queries issued against the database. This can reduce the overall load on the database. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because this is normally used for content distribution. <br />
- Option B is partially correct. But you need to have one more database as an internal load
  balancing
  solution. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because SNS is a simple notification service. <br />

<p>A.
Use Multi-AZ for the RDS instance to ensure that a secondary database is created in another region.</p>
<p>B.
Use the Read Replica feature to create another instance of the DB in another region.</p>
<p>C.

<p>D.
Use the Read Replica feature to create another instance of the DB in another Availability Zone.</p>

    Explanation

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the Multi-AZ feature allows high availability across Availability
  Zones, not regions. <br />

Options B and D are incorrect because Read Replicas can be used to offload database reads. But if
you want high availability, the Multi-AZ feature is required. <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB)
Instances. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB
Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability
Zone (AZ). <br />

requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Cluster placement group</p>
<p>B.
Spread placement group</p>
<p>C.

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – C <br />

Placement groups have the placement strategies of Cluster, Partition, and Spread. With the Partition
placement strategy, instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with other
partitions. This strategy is suitable for distributed and replicated workloads such as
Cassandra. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Cluster placement group puts instances together in an availability zone.
  This
  does not resolve the problem mentioned in the question. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Spread placement group puts instances across different racks. It
  does
  not group instances in a partition. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT: With the Partition placement group, instances in a partition have their own
  set
  of racks. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because there is no Network placement group. <br />

<p>You are creating several EC2 instances for a new application. The instances need to communicate with
each other. For a better performance of the application, both low network latency and high network
throughput are required for the EC2 instances. All instances should be launched in a single
availability zone. How would you configure this?</p>
<p>A.
Launch all EC2 instances in a placement group using a Cluster placement strategy.</p>
<p>B.
Auto assign a public IP when launching the EC2 instances.</p>
<p>C.
Launch EC2 instances in an EC2 placement group and select the Spread placement strategy.</p>
<p>D.
When launching the EC2 instances, select an instance type that supports enhanced networking</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – A <br />

The Cluster placement strategy helps to achieve a low-latency and high throughput network. The
reference is in
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-limitations-partition" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-limitations-partition</a> <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: The Cluster placement strategy can improve the network performance among EC2
  instances. The strategy can be selected when creating a placement group. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5_img_13.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-5" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B (Auto assign a public IP) does not affect network performance within an Availability
  Zone.
  Public IPs are primarily used for communication over the internet and are irrelevant for
  optimizing
  internal communication between EC2 instances. <br />

- Option C (Spread placement strategy) is designed to maximize instance resilience by spreading
  instances across multiple hardware to reduce the risk of simultaneous failure. While it improves
  fault tolerance, it does not enhance network performance between instances like a Cluster
  placement
  strategy does. <br />

- Option D Enhanced networking improves network performance by providing higher bandwidth and lower
  latency. However, it is not as effective as a Cluster placement strategy for achieving the highest
  performance in inter-instance communication. <br />

<p>A company hosts 5 web servers in AWS. They want to ensure that multiple values for a DNS query

your routing records with a Route 53 health check. Which routing policy should be used to fulfill
this requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Simple</p>
<p>B.
Weighted</p>
<p>C.
Multivalue Answer</p>
<p>D.
Latency</p>
<div class="toggle-wrapper">

        onclick="toggleContent(this)"
        data-label-show="Explanation"
    data-label-hide="Hide"
    >
    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - C <br />

The AWS Documentation mentions the following to support this: <br />

If you want to route traffic randomly to multiple resources such as web servers, you can create one
multivalue answer record for each resource and, optionally, associate an Amazon Route 53 health
check with each record. <br />

For example, suppose you manage an HTTP web service with a dozen web servers where each has its own
IP address. No web server could handle all the traffic. But if you create a dozen multivalue answer
records, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records in response to
each DNS query. Amazon Route53 gives different answers to different DNS resolvers. If a web server
becomes unavailable after a resolver cache a response, client software can try another IP address in
the response. <br />

Simple routing policy – Use a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, such
as a web server that serves the example.com website. <br />
Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple locations, and you want to route
traffic to the resource that provides the best latency. <br />
Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you
specify. <br />
Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route53 to respond to DNS queries with up to
eight healthy records selected randomly. <br />
