Correct Answer: C <br />

Brand Voice is a customer engagement that allows the Amazon Polly team to create a customized NTTS (
Neural Text-to-Speech) voice. This voice can be used within the organization for various use cases
such as unique vocal identifiers for specific products. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Custom Lexicons with Amazon Polly can be used to modify pronunciations of
  certain words in a text, such as company names, acronyms, foreign words, and neologisms. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as custom SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags with Amazon Polly
  support speech synthesis to allow certain words in a text in different styles. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Newscaster Speaking Style with Amazon Polly allows the synthesis of the
  speech to make it sound as if it’s spoken by a TV or radio newscaster. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: D <br />

Amazon Comprehend is a fully managed NLP (natural language processing) service that uses machine
learning to analyze, understand and interpret meanings from a text document. Amazon Comprehend can
be commonly used for the following cases, <br />

Voice of Customer Analytics <br />
Semantic Search <br />
Knowledge management and discovery <br />
The Amazon Comprehend can read data from the Amazon S3 bucket and write results to any AWS storage,
database, or data warehousing resources. <br />

For the above case, the company can store all the files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The Amazon
Comprehend will read the data from these files and process the text files to extract the keywords
such as Ticket returns and Flight complaints. It will store the output in Amazon Redshift which can
be used to perform further processing of the data based upon labels added by Amazon
Comprehend. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_1.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect as the Amazon Comprehend does not support reading data from Amazon EFS
  volumes. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as the Amazon Comprehend does not support reading data from Amazon EBS
  volumes. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as the Amazon Comprehend can read data from Amazon S3 and write data to
  Amazon
  Redshift, but not vice versa.

<h4 id="question-4">Question 4</h4>
<p>A Company has provisioned a website in the US West (N. California) region using Amazon EC2 instance
and Amazon CloudFront. The company is using IAM to control access to these resources. The client
plans to use a third-party SSL/TLS certificate to support HTTPS. As an AWS consultant, you have been
engaged to advise importing the certificate and using it along with Amazon CloudFront. Certificates
should be easily imported, and you should monitor the expiration dates of imported certificates.</p>
<p>How can certificates be provisioned to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Import the third-party certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region of AWS Certificate Manager
and use it for Amazon CloudFront in the US West (N. California) region</p>
<p>B.
Import the third-party certificate in the US West (N. California) region of AWS Certificate Manager
and use it for Amazon CloudFront in the US West (N. California) region</p>
<p>C.
Import the third-party certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region of IAM Certificate Manager
and use it for Amazon CloudFront in the US West (N. California) region</p>
<p>D.
Import the third-party certificate in the US West (N. California) region of IAM Certificate Manager

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon Certificate Manager supports provisioning and managing SSL/TLS certificates to be used by
Amazon resources. It also supports importing the certificates from third-party vendors. For
certificates imported from third-party vendors, ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) monitors expiration
dates for these certificates. <br />

For Amazon Certificate Manager with Amazon CloudFront, certificates need to be imported in US East (
N. Virginia) and used for CloudFront in any of the supported regions. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as for using ACM with Amazon CloudFront, third-party certificates must be
  imported in the US East (N. Virginia) region and not in US West (N. California). <br />
  Options C and D are incorrect as IAM Certificate Manager is recommended to be used only as an
  alternative to AWS Certificate Manager for regions in which AWS Certificate manager is not
  supported. <br />

<h4 id="question-5">Question 5</h4>
<p>The Developer Team has deployed a new application using Amazon Aurora DB cluster. This cluster has a
primary instance and five Aurora Replicas. While testing this application, it was observed that the
primary instance is getting overutilized with the read requests. Before going to production, the
Project Manager wants you to analyze the issue and suggest changes.</p>
<p>Which design changes can a solution architect propose to the application?</p>
<p>A.
Point application to the custom endpoint of the Amazon Aurora</p>
<p>B.
Point application to cluster endpoint of the Amazon Aurora</p>
<p>C.
Point read queries to the reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora</p>
<p>D.
Point application to instance endpoint of the Amazon Aurora</p>

    >
    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

Following are different endpoints supported with Amazon Aurora, <br />

Cluster Endpoint: It connects to the primary DB instance of the DB cluster. <br />
Reader Endpoint: It load balances between all the available Aurora Read Replicas in a DB
cluster. <br />
Custom Endpoint: It connects to the user-defined DB instance of the DB cluster. <br />
Instance Endpoint: It connects to a specific DB instance of the DB cluster. <br />
In the above scenario, the primary instance of the Amazon Aurora DB cluster is getting overutilized
with the read requests. To avoid this issue, applications can point to read replicas for read
queries. When an application is pointed to the reader endpoint, read queries get load-balanced
amongst the available number of read replicas. This primary instance is used only for the write
operations reducing the load on this instance. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as custom endpoints are used to specify particular instances in the DB
  cluster. These are useful to handle queries from specific instances in a DB cluster. In the above
  scenario, read queries need to be load balanced amongst the read replicas to reduce the load on
  primary instances. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as cluster endpoints point to the primary instance of the Aurora DB cluster.
  This option doesn’t fulfill the given requirement. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as instance endpoints are used to specify particular instances in the DB
  cluster. These are useful to manually load balance queries to distribute the workload amongst the
  instances in an Aurora DB cluster. <br />

<h4 id="question-6">Question 6</h4>
<p>A gaming company stores large size (terabytes to petabytes) of clickstream events data</p>
<p>into their central S3 bucket. The company wants to analyze this clickstream data to generate
business insight. Amazon Redshift, hosted securely in a private subnet of a VPC, is used for all
data warehouse-related and analytical solutions. Using Amazon Redshift, the company wants to explore
some solutions to securely run complex analytical queries on the clickstream data stored in S3
without transforming/copying or loading the data in the Redshift.</p>
<p>As a Solutions Architect, which of the following AWS services would you recommend for this
requirement, knowing that security and cost are two major priorities for the company?</p>
<p>A.
Create a VPC endpoint to establish a secure connection between Amazon Redshift and the S3 central
bucket and use Amazon Athena to run the query</p>
<p>B.
Use NAT Gateway to connect Amazon Redshift to the internet and access the S3 static website. Use
Amazon Redshift Spectrum to run the query</p>
<p>C.
Create a VPC endpoint to establish a secure connection between Amazon Redshift and the S3 central
bucket and use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to run the query</p>
<p>D.
Create Site-to-Site VPN to set up a secure connection between Amazon Redshift and the S3 central
bucket and use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to run the query</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Athena can directly query data in S3. Hence this will bypass
  the use of Redshift, which is not the requirement for the customer. They insisted on Amazon
  Redshift
  for the query purpose for usage. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Even though it is possible, NAT Gateway will connect Redshift to the
  internet
  and make the solution less secure. Plus, this is also not a cost-effective solution. Remember that
  security and cost both are important for the company. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT because VPC Endpoint is a secure and cost-effective way to connect a VPC with
  Amazon S3 privately, and the traffic does not pass through the internet. Using Amazon Redshift
  Spectrum, one can run queries against the data stored in the S3 bucket without needing the data to
  be copied to Amazon Redshift. This meets both the requirements of building a secure yet
  cost-effective solution. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Site-to-Site VPN is used to connect an on-premises data center to
  AWS
  Cloud securely over the internet and is suitable for use cases like Migration, Hybrid Cloud,
  etc. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

Data protection refers to the protection of data while in transit (as it travels to and from Amazon
S3) and at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). <br />

While data in transit can be protected using Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
or client-side encryption, one has the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon
S3: <br />

Server-Side Encryption – Request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its
data centers and then decrypt it when you download the objects. <br />

There are three types of Server-side encryption: <br />

Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) <br />
Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) <br />
Server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) <br />
Client-Side Encryption – Encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In
this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools. <br />

In this scenario, the customer is referring to data at rest. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because data security is the top priority for the team, and they want to use
  their own encryption key. In this option, the customer provides the encryption key while S3
  manages
  encryption - decryption. So there won’t be any operational overhead, yet the customer will have
  better control in managing the key. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because each object is encrypted with a unique key when you use Server-Side
  Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3). It also encrypts the key itself with a root key
  that rotates regularly. <br />
  This encryption type uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced
  Encryption
  Standard (AES-256) GCM, to encrypt your data, but it does not let customers create or manage the
  key. Hence this is not a choice here. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is similar to
  SSE-S3 but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service. <br />
  There are separate permissions for the use of a KMS key that provides protection against
  unauthorized access to your objects in Amazon S3. <br />

This option is mainly neglected because AWS still manages the storage of the encryption key or
master key (in KMS) while encryption-decryption is managed by the customer. The expectation from the
team in the above scenario is just the opposite. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_3.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option D is incorrect because, in this case, one has to manage the encryption process, the
  encryption keys, and related tools. And it is mentioned clearly above that the team does not want
  that.

<h4 id="question-8">Question 8</h4>
<p>An online retail company stores a large number of customer data (terabytes to petabytes) into Amazon
S3.The company wants to drive some business insight out of this data. They plan to securely run
SQL-based complex analytical queries on the S3 data directly and process it to generate business
insights and build a data visualization dashboard for the business and management review and
decision-making.</p>
<p>You are hired as a Solutions Architect to provide a cost-effective and quick solution to this. Which
of the following AWS services would you recommend?</p>
<p>A.
Use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to run SQL-based queries on the data stored in Amazon S3 and then
process it to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for creating a dashboard</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon Redshift to run SQL-based queries on the data stored in Amazon S3 and then process it on
a custom web-based dashboard for data visualization</p>
<p>C.
Use Amazon EMR to run SQL-based queries on the data stored in Amazon S3 and then process it to

Correct Answer: D <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics cannot be used to generate business
  insights as mentioned in the requirement. It neither can be used for data visualization. <br />
  One must depend on some BI tool after processing data from Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. It is
  not
  a cost-optimized solution. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_4.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect primarily due to the cost factors. Using Amazon Redshift for querying S3
  data
  requires the transfer and loading of the data to Redshift instances. It also takes time and
  additional cost to create a custom web-based dashboard or data visualization tool. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon EMR is a cloud big data platform for running large-scale
  distributed data processing jobs, interactive SQL queries, and machine learning (ML) applications
  using open-source analytics frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto. It is mainly
  used to perform big data analytics, process real-time data streams, accelerate data science and ML
  adoption. The requirement here is not to build any of such solutions on a Big Data platform. Hence
  this option is not suitable. It is neither quick nor cost-effective compared to option D. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT because Amazon Athena is the most cost-effective solution to run SQL-based
  analytical queries on S3 data and then publish it to Amazon QuickSight for dashboard view. <br />

<p>An organization has archived all their data to Amazon S3 Glacier for a long term. However, the
organization needs to retrieve some portion of the archived data regularly. This retrieval process
is quite random and incurs a good amount of cost for the organization. As expense is the top
priority, the organization wants to set a data retrieval policy to avoid any data retrieval charges.</p>
<p>Which one of the following retrieval policies suits this in the best way?</p>
<p>A.
No Retrieval Limit</p>
<p>B.
Free Tier Only</p>
<p>C.
Max Retrieval Rate</p>
<p>D.
Standard Retrieval</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because No Retrieval Limit, the default data retrieval policy, is used when
  you do not want to set any retrieval quota. All valid data retrieval requests are accepted. This
  retrieval policy incurs a high cost to your AWS account for each region. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because using a Free Tier Only policy, you can keep your retrievals within
  your
  daily AWS Free Tier allowance and not incur any data retrieval costs. And in this policy, S3
  Glacier
  synchronously rejects retrieval requests that exceed your AWS Free Tier allowance. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because you use Max Retrieval Rate policy when you want to retrieve more
  data
  than what is in your AWS Free Tier allowance. Max Retrieval Rate policy sets a bytes-per-hour
  retrieval-rate quota. The Max Retrieval Rate policy ensures that the peak retrieval rate from all
  retrieval jobs across your account in an AWS Region does not exceed the bytes-per-hour quota that
  you set. Max Retrieval rate policy is not in the free tier. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Standard Retrieval is a process of data retrieval from S3 Glacier
  that
  takes around 12 hours to retrieve data. This retrieval type is chargeable and incurs costs on the
  AWS account per region wise. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: D <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for
  delivering
  real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch,
  etc.
  It cannot create GraphQL API. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service
  that
  makes it easy to build and run applications. It is a database and cannot be used to create GraphQL
  API. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_8.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect because Amazon API Gateway supports RESTful APIs (HTTP and REST API) and
  WebSocket APIs. It is not meant for the development of GraphQL API. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT because with AWS AppSync one can create serverless GraphQL APIs that simplify
  application development by providing a single endpoint to securely query or update data from
  multiple data sources and leverage GraphQL to implement engaging real-time application
  experiences. <br />

thousands of simultaneous clients, driving millions of IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)
with sub-millisecond latency. The company needs a cost-optimized file system storage for short-term,
processing-heavy workloads that can provide burst throughput to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>What type of file systems storage will suit the company in the best way?</p>
<p>A.
FSx for Lustre with Deployment Type as Scratch File System</p>
<p>B.
FSx for Lustre with Deployment Type as Persistent file systems</p>
<p>C.
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

File system deployment options for FSx for Lustre: <br />

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides two file system deployment options: scratch and persistent. <br />

Both deployment options support solid-state drive (SSD) storage. However, hard disk drive (HDD)
storage is supported only in one of the persistent deployment types. <br />

You choose the file system deployment type when you create a new file system using the AWS
Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon FSx for Lustre
API. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_9.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is CORRECT because FSx for Lustre with Deployment Type as Scratch File System is designed
  for temporary storage and shorter-term data processing. Data isn't replicated and doesn't persist
  if
  a file server fails. Scratch file systems provide high burst throughput of up to six times the
  baseline throughput of 200 MBps per TiB storage capacity. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_10.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect because FSx for Lustre with Deployment Type as Persistent file systems are
  designed for longer-term storage and workloads. The file servers are highly available, and data is
  automatically replicated within the same Availability Zone in which the file system is located.
  The
  data volumes attached to the file servers are replicated independently from the file servers to
  which they are attached. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_11.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect because Amazon EFS is not as effective as Amazon FSx for Luster when it
  comes
  to HPC design to deliver millions of IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second) with
  sub-millisecond
  latency. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. The storage requirement here is for POSIX-compliant file systems to support
  Linux-based workloads. Hence Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is not suitable here. <br />

Answer: D <br />

You can associate secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks with your VPC. When you associate a CIDR block with
your VPC, a route is automatically added to your VPC route tables to enable routing within the VPC (
the destination is the CIDR block and the target is local). <br />

In the following example, the VPC on the left has a single CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16) and two subnets.
The VPC on the right represents the architecture of the same VPC after you've added a second CIDR
block (10.2.0.0/16) and created a new subnet from the range of the second CIDR. <br />

<br />
From the above image, the Main route table shows the routes for primary and secondary IP ranges. So
the correct option is D. <br />

For option A, VPC peering connection route contains Target as pcx-xxxxxx. <br />
For option B, the routing table should contain an entry with 'vgw-xxxxx' for a VPN
connection. <br />
For option C, the Direct Connect connection route should contain the Target as vgw-xxxxxx. <br />

five years). The data will be rarely accessed once per quarter but requires immediate retrieval (in
milliseconds). You are a Solutions Architect in the organization and the organization wants your
suggestion to select a suitable storage class here. Which of the following would you recommend for
the given requirement?</p>
<p>A.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval</p>
<p>B.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier) is the ideal
  storage class to archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to
  retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases. <br />
  S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers the most flexible retrieval options that balance cost with
  access times ranging from minutes to hours and with free bulk retrievals. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because S3 Glacier Deep Archive delivers the lowest cost storage, up to 75%
  lower cost (than S3 Glacier), for long-lived archive data accessed less than once per year. It is
  designed for customers — particularly those in the financial services, healthcare, media and
  entertainment, and public sectors that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet customer
  needs and regulatory compliance requirements. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT because the Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class is the
  lowest-cost
  storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed but needs instant access in milliseconds to be
  used for online file-sharing applications, image hosting, etc. <br />
  It can save storage costs up to 68% if the data is retrieved once in a quarter, compared to S3
  Infrequent Access (IA). <br />

- Option D is incorrect because S3 Standard-Infrequent Access is not cost-effective storage for
  long-lived data. Actually, it is the most expensive among all the options here. <br />

Correct Answer: D <br />

- Option A is incorrect because this does not meet the condition of having secure access, plus this
  is
  also an overload of the operational and management team to manage external users. Also, you are
  not
  supposed to share the user details or credentials etc. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Allowing external users in IAM policy is not a secure solution as explained
  above for Option A. Plus SCP does not have any effect outside organizations which is the Audit
  firm
  in this case. So only bucket policy can resolve this access issue - All three are not needed
  here. <br />

- Option D is CORRECT. <br />
  Bucket Policy for Account-Level Access: <br />
  Adding a bucket policy that allows access to the external audit firm's AWS account ensures secure
  and direct access to the required resources without creating or sharing IAM users or roles.

condition ensures that all access to the bucket happens over a secure HTTPS connection, protecting
data in transit. <br />

Avoids SCP Modifications: <br />
SCPs are used to control access across AWS accounts within an organization. Modifying SCPs to grant
bucket access would complicate management and is unnecessary for this use case. <br />

No IAM User Sharing: <br />
Creating a shared IAM user introduces unnecessary operational and security risks, such as managing
credentials and access permissions. <br />

<h4 id="question-15">Question 15</h4>
<p>A customer is looking for file storage in AWS that supports Network File System version 4 (NFSv4.1
and NFSv4.0) protocol. They want a simple, serverless, set-and-forget service that can grow and
shrink automatically as they add and remove files. Accessibility of these files is going to be
random and infrequent. The customer is also looking for an option to save cost by transitioning the
files that have not been accessed for quite some time automatically to a low-cost storage tier. As a
Solution Architect, which storage service will you choose that fits the customer&rsquo;s requirement
perfectly?</p>
<p>A.
Use Amazon S3 for storage as it is for better cost-saving option</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon S3 Glacier for the storage</p>
<p>C.
Use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) with lifecycle policy</p>
<p>D.
Amazon FSx for Lustre</p>
<div class="toggle-wrapper">

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because S3 is indeed low cost, serverless storage, but not suitable for file
  storage with the NFSv4 protocol. Also, the auto adjustment of the storage based on the addition or
  deletion of files indicates towards Elastic File System (EFS). <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Amazon S3 Glacier is the storage for archived data. <br />
  The Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes are purpose-built for data archiving and are the lowest cost
  archive storage in the cloud. <br />

Data archival is not a requirement here. Stress is more on elasticity and automatic transition.
Hence EFS with a Lifecycle rule would be the right choice. <br />

- Option C is CORRECT because Amazon EFS fits all the requirements of being an elasticity and
  self-managed serverless storage service. In addition, when it enabled EFS Lifecycle Management, it
  will automatically handle cost-effective file storage. In this option, you set a period of time in
  Transition into IA. Based on that, the lifecycle policy will archive your file to the EFS
  Standard–Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) or One Zone–Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA) storage
  class,
  depending on your file system if the files haven’t been accessed for that defined period of
  time. <br />
  Amazon EFS supports two lifecycle policies. <br />

Transition into IA instructs lifecycle management on when to transit files into the file systems'
Infrequent Access storage class. <br />
Transition out of IA instructs intelligent tiering when to transit files out of IA storage.
Lifecycle policies apply to the entire Amazon EFS file system. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because Amazon FSX for Luster is a costly storage mainly used for
  High-Performance Computing (HPC). It is not a good fit for the given requirement of the
  customer. <br />

<p>Your organization had setup a VPC with CIDR range 10.10.0.0/16. There are total 100 subnets within
the VPC and are being actively used by multiple application teams. An application team who is using
50 EC2 instances in subnet 10.10.55.0/24 complains there are intermittent outgoing network
connection failures for around 30 random EC2 instances in a given day. How would you troubleshoot
issue with minimal configuration and minimal logs written?</p>
<p>A.
Create a flow log for the VPC and filter the logs in CloudWatch log group.</p>
<p>B.
Create flow log for each EC2 instance network interface one by one and troubleshoot the connection
issue.</p>
<p>C.
Create a flow log for subnet 10.10.55.0/24.</p>
<p>D.
None of the above.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: C <br />

VPC Flow Logs captures IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data is
stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its
data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. <br />

You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html#flow-logs-basics"> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html#flow-logs-basics </a> <br />
VPC Flow Logs capture following information and logs them to CloudWatch logs, <br />

version account-id interface-id srcaddr dstaddr srcport dstport protocol packets bytes start end
action log-status <br />

Find more information about each record here. <br />

For option A, although creating a flow log for entire VPC would work, it captures lot of unrequired
information from rest 99 subnets and finding out the affected EC2 instances from CloudWatch logs
would become really troublesome. <br />

For Option B, creating flow log at each EC2 network interface would work, but it takes log of
configuration and time consuming trial and error troubleshooting. <br />
For Option C, creating a flow log for the subnet would capture just the traffic going in and out of
the subnet. This would help us identify the network trace for the affected EC2 instances and find
out the root cause in timely manner. <br />

Correct Answers: A and D <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because AWS System Manager Application Manager is the capability of AWS
  Systems
  Manager which helps DevOps engineers to investigate and remediate issues with their AWS resources
  in
  the context of their applications and clusters. Application Manager reduces the time taken by the
  DevOps engineers to detect and investigate issues with AWS resources. <br />

- Option D is CORRECT because AWS System Manager Parameter Store is a capability of AWS System
  Manager
  that provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets
  management.
  You can store data such as passwords, database strings, Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and
  license
  codes as parameter values. <br />
  AWS Parameter Store is designed not just for secrets or passwords, but also for application
  configuration variables like URLs, Custom settings, AMI IDs, License keys, etc. This is low cost
  and
  does not cause rotation of the secrets like AWS Secret Manager does. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because AWS AppSync cannot help in failure analysis; it is a serverless
  service to create fully managed GraphQL API. It is not suitable for the requirement given. Find
  more
  about AWS AppSync
  here <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/ </a> <br />
- Option C is incorrect because AWS Secrets Manager enables you to rotate, manage, and retrieve
  database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. It is designed
  specifically for RDS confidential information (like database credentials and API keys etc.) that
  needs to be encrypted. In the above use case, it was mentioned to have a service that is
  cost-effective and does not rotate the secrets. Hence the use of AWS Parameter Store is more
  preferable than AWS Secret Manager. <br />
  Check the difference between them
  below: <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-secrets-manager-and-parameter-store-systems-manager-f02686604eae"> https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-secrets-manager-and-parameter-store-systems-manager-f02686604eae </a> <br />

- Option E is incorrect because using Amazon S3 for storing secrets is not a security best practice.
  Technically it could be possible, but if you choose this option, you will put the DevOps team into
  another compliance issue.

<h4 id="question-18">Question 18</h4>
<p>An organization in the banking sector has got their AWS resources distributed in multiple
Availability Zones (AZ) in a region. They share one NAT gateway to connect to all their RDS
instances placed in Private Subnet in different AZs to the internet. While trying to perform some
Database related operations, the employee of the organization reported intermittent connectivity
issues. However, on checking the logs in AWS, they found that the RDS instances were all up and
running during the time when the issue was reported.</p>
<p>You are hired as a Solution Architect to identify the root cause of this connectivity issue and
remediate it without compromising security and resiliency. How would you approach this?</p>
<p>A.
The customer experiences a connectivity issue when the NAT gateway’s Availability Zone goes down. To
remediate this, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure
that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone</p>
<p>B.
The customer experiences a connectivity issue due to insufficient IAM Policy and Roles. Resolve this
by adding the required permissions in the IAM Policy and attach them to the role used for the AWS
resources</p>
<p>C.
The customer experiences a connectivity issue due to low bandwidth in their network. Ask the
customer to sign up for a higher bandwidth plan with the network provider/operator</p>
<p>D.
The customer experiences the connectivity issue when the NAT gateway’s Availability Zone goes down.
To remediate this, remove the NAT gateway and use VPC Peering to connect to the Multi-AZ RDS
instances</p>

Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because when you have resources in multiple Availability Zones, and they share
  one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gateway’s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other
  Availability Zones lose internet access. In order to create an Availability Zone-independent
  architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure
  that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the issue reported above is not caused by IAM Policies or Roles. It
  is
  mainly because of the fact that the Availability Zone of Nat Gateway goes down. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because the issue reported above is not caused by the network bandwidth or
  anything related to network speed etc. It is mainly because of the fact that the Availability Zone
  of Nat Gateway goes down. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because even though it reasoned out the right cause, the remediation is not
  correct. VPC Pairing is a connection that interconnects multiple VPCs and enables traffic between
  them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. VPC Pairing does not let them access the
  internet. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: D <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon DocumentDB is a scalable, highly durable, and fully managed
  database service for operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads. Amazon DocumentDB is not
  suitable
  for the requirement of a relationship mapping database that helps identify patterns. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL
  database designed to run high performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in
  security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data
  export
  tools. Amazon DynamoDB is not suitable for the requirement of a relationship-based or
  mapping-based
  database. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Aurora is a relational database management system (RDBMS)

Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is scalable, highly
  durable, and fully managed database service for operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads. As
  it
  comes with MongoDB compatibility, the migration from MongoDB to DocumentDB gets very easy without
  changing the schema. The existing applications remain as they are without changing the
  code. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL
  database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in
  security, continuous backups, automated multi-Region replication, in-memory caching, and data
  export
  tools. Amazon DynamoDB is not suitable for the requirement of a MongoDB compatible
  database. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Keyspaces is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache
  Cassandra–compatible database service. With Amazon Keyspaces, you can run your Cassandra workloads
  on AWS by using the same Cassandra application code and developer tools that you use today. This
  option is not suitable for MongoDB migration. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database
  service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.
  The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized

  Boundary. Other roles could create resources outside eu-west-1. It is also important to remark
  that
  SCPs are not related to the IAM Permissions Boundary. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because the policy statement is matching that all the resources being created
  outside of eu-west-1 will be denied. The policy is also attached to the OU=development. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because the OU where we want to apply the policy is the OU=development, not
  the whole AWS Organization. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because the policy statement is not being applied to an OU. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the maximum size that can be transferred is 5TB. 150GB is
  considerable
  when using NFS for data transfer. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because the maximum size that can be transferred is 5TB. The file that we are
  trying to upload is higher than 5TB. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because the issue is during the AWS client validation, not a permission
  denied
  issue caused by the Policy statements. This is also an impossible cause. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon S3 doesn’t support files larger than 5TB.

Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is a feature of Amazon ECS that enables you to run
and manage container workloads on customer-managed infrastructure efficiently. <br />
ECS Anywhere builds upon the ease and simplicity of Amazon ECS to provide a consistent tooling and
API experience across your container-based applications. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT because you need AWS Systems Manager to supply a secret activation code that
  allows the agent to register itself with AWS Systems Manager as a managed instance, which is
  necessary to run your instances on ECS Anywhere. <br />
  Also, it is necessary for the Amazon ECS agent to have connectivity with your ECS Cluster. <br />
  Docker is used if you want to run container workloads on-prem. <br />
  And you can apply the following command on your Linux instance to register to the Amazon
  ECS: <br />

curl --proto "https" -o "
/tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh" "<a target="_blank" href="https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install-latest.sh"> https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install-latest.sh </a> &&
bash /tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh --region "YourRegion" --cluster "Cluster-name" --activation-id "
xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx" --activation-code "xxxxxxxxx" <br />

- Option B is incorrect because Amazon ECS agents must also be included, if not, the servers can’t
  be
  registered on the ECS cluster. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Systems Manager Agent must also be included, if not, the
  servers will not be registered as managed instances and will not complete the registration of the
  servers into the ECS Cluster. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as we are missing the Amazon Systems Manager Agent. Amazon CloudWatch agent
  would provide the possibility to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch , but the servers will not be
  able to register. <br />

Correct Answer: C <br />

Amazon EKS Anywhere is a deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and
operate Kubernetes clusters on customer-managed infrastructure, supported by AWS. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the question clearly mentions there is a need for the Kubernetes
  ecosystem, so no need for Amazon ECS or Amazon ECS Anywhere. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the question mentions that the DevOps engineers of the company are
  running their workloads on bare metal servers and would like to continue with that. So there is no
  need to move the workloads to Amazon EKS. <br />
- Option C is correct because the engineer wants to run their workloads on hardware only with no
  virtualization, so it is good to deploy the Amazon EKS Anywhere technology on bare metal nodes.
  Running Kubernetes on bare metal instances will take full advantage of the servers because the
  operating system is communicating with the physical hardware. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because the question mentions that the engineer wants to continue with
  hardware only without virtualization. If no virtualization then no need for VMware vSphere. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

Amazon ECS Anywhere allows the company to deploy and manage containerized applications in both
on-premises and cloud environments. By deploying the AWS Systems Manager agent onto customer-managed
operating systems, the company can centrally manage and automate administrative tasks for these
instances, effectively converting them into managed instances. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service and is suitable for
  deploying and managing containerized applications in the cloud, it does not directly address the
  requirement for managing on-premises instances and converting them into managed instances. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Elastic Container Registry is a fully managed Docker
  container
  registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container
  images. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon EKS Distro is a Kubernetes distribution that is compatible
  with
  Amazon EKS. While it allows for running Kubernetes clusters on-premises, it does not directly
  address the requirement for managing on-premises instances and converting them into managed
  instances. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves and provides
tools that you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and
opportunities for optimization. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon CloudWatch can check your application's logs and monitoring
  dashboards, but you can’t trace specific traffic calls. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because you can analyze different request calls happening in your application
  with AWS X-Ray. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Event Bridge is for managing Services events, not tracing or
  monitoring applications. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon CloudTrail is an auditing solution. You can check API calls
  for
  your account, but it can’t provide you with traces from your application <br />

Adopting Amazon EKS Anywhere allows to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters both on-premises and in
the AWS cloud environment. This option provides a consistent operational experience, ease of
management, and seamless integration with AWS services, fulfilling the requirements
effectively. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Leveraging ECS Anywhere focuses on managing containerized

  for Kubernetes cluster management. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Utilizing Amazon EKS to manage Kubernetes clusters exclusively
  within
  the AWS cloud environment does not address the requirement to manage clusters across on-premises
  data centers and AWS cloud environment. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Deploying Kubernetes clusters on-premises using the EKS Distro and

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: D <br />

The IDENTIFIED WITH clause allows MariaDB and MySQL to use the AWSAuthenticationPlugin to
authenticate the database account (iam_db_user). The AS 'RDS' clause refers to the authentication
method. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the command is missing the clause that refers to the authentication
  method “as RDS”. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the command is missing the clause that refers to the authentication
  method and the clause which allows Aurora MySQL to use the AWSAuthenticationPlugin. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because renaming the IAM user is not a valid option to provide
  authentication.
  You need to create a new user for the Aurora RDS Database. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT because you need to create a USER on your database with the clause referring
  to
  the authentication method and the clause that allows Aurora MySQL to use the
  AWSAuthenticationPlugin. <br />

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams is specifically designed to securely ingest, process, and analyze video
streams in real-time. It provides the necessary scalability, low latency, and integration with other
AWS services to meet the company's requirements for monitoring road conditions and driver
behavior. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because AWS IoT Core is suitable for connecting IoT devices and managing
  device communication, it is not optimized for handling video streams and analyzing video
  data. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a service for ingesting and

Correct Answer: B <br />

The question asks for the NACL rule when the instances and transit gateway are in different subnets
and traffic flows from EC2 instance to transit gateway. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. For traffic outbound from your EC2 instance subnet, the source IP address
  is
  not valid, the destination IP address is used to evaluate the rule. <br />
- Option B is correct. This is the required rule NACLs should follow when the instances and transit
  gateway are in different subnets and the traffic flows from instances to the transit
  gateway. <br />
  Network ACL Outbound rules use the destination IP address to evaluate traffic from the instances
  to
  the transit gateway. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because when the instances and transit gateway are in different subnets,
  outbound rules are evaluated and provide the flow of traffic as required.   <br />
- Option D is incorrect. For traffic inbound from your transit gateway, the source IP address is
  used
  to evaluate the rule. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

DB snapshot can be shared with other authorized AWS accounts which can be up to 20 accounts. These
snapshots can be either in encrypted or unencrypted format. <br />

For manual snapshots in an unencrypted format, accounts can directly restore a DB instance from the
snapshot. <br />

For manual snapshots in an encrypted format, accounts first need to copy the snapshot and then
restore it to a DB instance. <br />

While sharing a manual unencrypted snapshot, all accounts can use this snapshot to restore to the DB
instance when DB snapshot visibility is set to public. <br />

While sharing a manual unencrypted snapshot, only specified accounts can restore a DB instance when
DB snapshot visibility is set to private. <br />

In the case of manual encrypted snapshots, the only available option for DB snapshot visibility is
private, as encrypted snapshots cannot be made public. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as marking DB snapshot visibility as the public is not an ideal option since
  snapshots need to share only with specific accounts. Marking DB snapshot visibility as public will
  provide all Amazon accounts access to the manual snapshot and will be able to restore DB instances
  using this snapshot. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as DB instances can be directly restored from the snapshot for a manual
  unencrypted snapshot. There is no need to create a copy of the snapshot to restore a DB
  instance. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as already discussed, marking DB snapshot visibility as the public is not an
  ideal option. For a manual unencrypted snapshot, DB instances can be directly restored from the
  snapshot. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

Amazon Aurora Database reliability can be increased by adding Aurora Replicas to the primary DB
instance and placing them in different Availability zones. Each of the DB clusters can have a
primary DB instance and up to 15 Aurora Replicas. In case of primary DB instance failure, Aurora
automatically fails over to replicas. Amazon Aurora also uses the following automatic features to
enhance reliability, <br />

Storage auto-repair: Aurora maintains multiple copies of the data in three different Availability
zones. This helps in avoiding data loss post disk failure. If any segment of the disk fails, Aurora
automatically recovers data on the segment by using data stored in other cluster volumes. This
reduces additional work to perform point-in-time restoration post disk failure. <br />
Survivable page cache: Manage page cache in a separate process than the database. In the event of
database failure, the page cache is stored in the memory. Post restarting the database, applications
continue to read data from the page cache providing performance gain. <br />
Crash recovery: Crash recovery can be used for faster recovery post any crash in the database. With
the crash recovery feature, Amazon Aurora performs recovery asynchronously on parallel threads
enabling applications to read data from the database without binary logs. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Aurora Replicas should be created in different Availability zones and not
  in
  different regions for better availability. The crash recovery does not minimize data loss post
  disk
  failures. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. The Survivable page cache feature provides performance gains but does not
  minimize data loss post disk failures. Aurora Replicas should be created in different Availability
  zones and not in different regions. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as the crash recovery feature does not minimize data loss post disk
  failures. <br />

Correct Answer: D <br />

RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is a period for which downtime is observed post-disaster. It’s the
time between the disaster and application recovery to serve full workloads. RPO (Recovery Point
Objective) defines the amount of data loss during a disaster. It measures the time window when the
last backup was performed, and the time when the disaster happened. Various Disaster recovery
solutions can be deployed based on RTO/RPO and budget requirements for critical applications. <br />

The following are options available with Disaster recovery, <br />

Backup and Restore: Least expensive among all the options but RTO/RPO will be very high in hours.
All backup resources will be initiated only after a disaster at the primary location. <br />
Pilot Light: Less expensive than warm standby and multi-site active/active. RTO/RPO happens in tens
of minutes. <br />
In this strategy, a minimum number of active resources are deployed at the backup locations.
Resources required for data synchronization between primary and backup locations are only
provisioned and are active. Other components such as application servers are switched off and are
provisioned post a disaster at the primary location. In the above scenario, Pilot Light is the most
suitable option to meet RTO/RPO requirements on a low budget. <br />

Warm Standby: Expensive Than Pilot Light. RPO/RTO happens in minutes. The application is running at
the backup location on scaled-down resource capacity. Once a disaster occurs at the primary
location, all the resources are scaled up to meet the desired workload. <br />
Multi-site active/active: Most expensive. No downtime or data loss is incurred as applications are
active from multiple regions. <br />
The following diagram shows the difference between each strategy with respect to RTO/RPO and
cost. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_20.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect as with a multi-site active/active approach, RPO/RTO will be the least, but
  it
  will incur considerable cost. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as, with a Warm Standby approach, RPO/RTO will be in minutes, but it will
  incur additional costs. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as with the Backup & Restore approach, RPO/RTO will be in hours, not in
  minutes. <br />

Correct Answer: D <br />

Amazon Route 53 uses control planes to perform management-related activities such as creating,
updating, and deleting resources. <br />

The Data plane is used for performing core services of Amazon Route 53 such as authoritative DNS
service, health checks, and responding to DNS queries in an Amazon VPC. <br />

The Data plane is globally distributed, offering 100% availability SLA. Control plane traffic is
optimized for data consistency and may be impacted during disruptive events in the
infrastructure. <br />

While configuring failover between multiple sites, data plane functions such as health checks should
be preferred instead of control plane functions. In the above case, multiple endpoints in different
regions can be associated with Route 53. Route 53 can be configured to failover to a healthy
endpoint based upon the health checks which is a data plane function and always available. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as updating weights in a weighted routing policy is a control plane
  function.
  For additional resiliency during a disaster, use data plane functions instead of control plane
  functions. <br />
  Options B and C are incorrect as creating, updating, and deleting private or public hosted zone
  records are part of control plane actions. In case of a disaster, control planes might get
  affected.
  Data plane functions such as health checks should be used for resources that are always
  available. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon EBS has a new storage tier named Amazon EBS Snapshots Archive for storing snapshots that are
accessed rarely and stored for long periods. <br />

By default, snapshots created from Amazon EBS volumes are stored in Amazon EBS Snapshot standard
tier. These are incremental snapshots. When EBS snapshots are archived, incremental snapshots are
converted to full snapshots. <br />

These snapshots are stored in the EBS Snapshots Archive instead of the standard tier. Storing
snapshots in the EBS Snapshots archive costs much less than storing snapshots in the standard tier.
EBS snapshot archive helps store snapshots for long durations for governance or compliance
requirements, which will be rarely accessed. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as it will require additional work for creating an AWS Lambda function. EBS
  Snapshots archive is a more efficient way of storing snapshots for the long term. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as using third-party storage will incur additional costs. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as all EBS snapshots are stored in a standard tier by default. Storing
  snapshots that will be rarely accessed in the standard tier will be costlier than storing in the
  EBS
  snapshots archive. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

Configure the Requester Pays: This option shifts the data transfer costs to the users who are
accessing the data. This way, the company can avoid incurring high data transfer charges, as the
users will be responsible for these costs. <br />

A. Configure Amazon CloudFront: While CloudFront can reduce latency by caching content at edge
locations, it doesn't necessarily minimize data transfer costs for cross-region access. It might
even add additional costs for CloudFront usage <br />

C. Pre-signed URLs: Pre-signed URLs can be used to grant temporary access to specific objects in S3,
but they don't directly reduce transfer charges. <br />

D. Replicating Data: Replicating data to multiple S3 buckets can be expensive and complex to manage.
It also doesn't guarantee that users will always access data from the closest region. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

In this scenario, where the requirement involves securely ingesting, processing, and analyzing live
video streams from various sources for audience engagement and quality monitoring, Amazon Kinesis
Video Streams is the most appropriate AWS service. It is specifically designed for handling live
video streams at scale, providing features like automatic scaling, data retention policies, and
integration with other AWS services for real-time analytics and processing. Therefore, - Option A is
the correct choice. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Firehose is designed for streaming data delivery to
  various destinations, making it less suitable for real-time analysis and processing of video
  streams. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because AWS IoT Greengrass extends IoT functionality to edge devices,
  allowing
  them to securely interact with cloud services, run local computations, and operate even when
  they're
  not connected to the internet. It is not optimized for handling video streams and performing
  real-time analysis of video content. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a general-purpose data streaming
  service, not specialized for video stream processing and analysis <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

Client-side encryption is selected when customers need to manage the encryption process, keys, and
tools themselves. With client-side encryption, Amazon S3 is not involved in the encryption process.
Data is encrypted locally before it’s saved to the Amazon S3 bucket and decrypted after it's
downloaded from the S3 bucket. <br />

There are the following two options with client-side encryption, <br />

Using AWS KMS: For encryption of data locally, AWS KMS keys are used by the customers. In this
option, an encryption key is stored in AWS KMS. <br />
Using keys stored within the application:  In this case, data is encrypted locally before saving to
the Amazon S3 bucket using the root key in the application. In this case, encryption keys need to be
managed by the customers. If keys are lost, decryption of data downloaded from the Amazon S3 bucket
is impossible. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. While using keys stored within the application, encryption keys need to be
  managed by the client. These keys need to be managed locally by the customer. If these keys are
  lost, decryption of data downloaded from the Amazon S3 bucket is impossible. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as customer-provided keys are used with server-side encryption, not for
  client-side encryption. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as the Amazon S3 bucket key is used while configuring server-side encryption
  using SSE-KMS. Bucket keys reduce request traffic from the S3 bucket to Amazon KMS and in turn,
  minimize the cost of using SSE-KMS. This cannot be used along with client-side encryption. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that can identify software vulnerabilities
and network exposure. It can be initiated on the Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon ECR (Elastic
Container Registry). For each of the findings, Amazon Inspector calculates a risk score by
correlating CVE (common vulnerability and exposures) along with network access and exploitability.
This score can help prioritize remediations on each of the instances. <br />

In the above case, Amazon Inspector can be enabled on the Amazon EC2 instance which will find
network ports opened unintentionally. Amazon Inspector will assign a risk score for each finding
which will help remediate critical findings first. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that can be used to
  monitor
  AWS accounts and workloads by analyzing AWS data sources, including AWS CloudTrail event logs,
  Amazon VPC flow Logs, and DNS query logs. It is not an ideal tool for vulnerability management on
  Amazon EC2 instances. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon Detective investigates data from various Amazon security services
  such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Security Hub along with partner security tools to
  identify the root cause of the security issues and findings. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as AWS Artifact can be used to get compliance reports for AWS resources from
  a
  single portal. It is not an ideal tool for vulnerability management on Amazon EC2
  instances. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

Amazon CloudTrail Log files can be encrypted in any of the two ways, <br />

SSE-KMS allows you to manage encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for added
security. <br />
The KMS key should be created in the same region as the Amazon S3 bucket storing the CloudTrail logs
for encryption and decryption. <br />
Using the same key for multiple accounts simplifies key management and secures the logs consistently
across accounts, which aligns with the requirements of the Security team to manage keys and control
access. <br />
A single key can be used for encrypting and decrypting log files for multiple accounts. With Amazon
KMS-managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS), the KMS key should be created in the same region as that of
the Amazon S3 bucket which is used to store Amazon CloudTrail logs. <br />

Options A and C are incorrect as AWS manages keys, and customers do not manage these keys with
Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. Also, customers cannot control permissions for using these
keys. <br />

- Option D is incorrect as the KMS key should be created in the same region as the Amazon S3 bucket
  to
  provide encryption or decryption.

Amazon Timestream ensures faster processing and is more cost-effective than storing such data in a
regular relational database. <br />

Amazon Timestream is integrated with data collection services in AWS such as Amazon Kinesis, and
Amazon MSK, and open-source tools such as Telegraf. Data stored in Amazon Timestream can be further
visualized using Amazon QuickSight. It can also be integrated with Amazon Sagemaker for machine
learning. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is best suited for traditional
  applications such as CRM (customer relationship management) and ERP (Enterprise resource
  planning).
  Using Amazon RDS for storing IoT sensor data will be costly and slow as compared to the Amazon
  Timestream. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as Amazon Neptune is suitable for creating graph databases querying large
  amounts of data. Amazon Neptune is not a suitable option for storing IoT sensor data. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon DynamoDB is suitable for web applications supporting key-value
  NoSQL
  databases. Using Amazon DynamoDB for storing IoT sensor data will be costly. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed database that supports JSON workloads for content management in
the AWS cloud. Amazon DocumentDB supports millions of requests per second with low latency. Amazon
DocumentDB has a flexible schema that can store data in different attributes and data values. Due to
the flexible schema, it's best suited for content management which allows users to store different
data types such as images, videos, and comments. <br />

With relational databases, for storing different documents, separate tables are required to store
different types of documents or need a single table with unused fields as null values. Amazon
DocumentDB is a semi-structured database that supports different formats of the documents in the
same document without null values. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as Amazon Neptune is suitable for creating graph databases querying large
  amounts of data. It is not a suitable option for content management with different data
  formats. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon Timestream is suitable for time series databases such as IoT base
  sensor data, DevOps, or clickstream data. It is not a suitable option for content management with
  different data formats. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Amazon Keyspaces is a highly available and scalable database supporting
  Apache Cassandra. It is not a suitable option for content management with different data
  formats. <br />

<p>James attempts to launch a t2.micro EC2 instance using the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy. He selects
the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and chooses not to associate a key pair. For the root volume, he configures
an 8 GB General Purpose (gp2) EBS volume and manually encrypts it using a specific KMS key. After
reviewing the configurations, he proceeds to launch the instance.</p>
<p>However, the instance transitions from &ldquo;Pending&rdquo; to &ldquo;Shutting Down&rdquo; and then to &ldquo;Terminated&rdquo; without
reaching the &ldquo;Running&rdquo; state. The error message indicates: Client.InternalError: Client error on
launch.</p>
<p>What is the most likely cause of this issue, and how can it be resolved?</p>
<p>A.
The EBS Volume is encrypted with a KMS key which James has no permission for decryption. The admin
should give him permission to access KMS Key</p>
<p>B.
The mentioned policy applies to only certain instance types. James should try launching the EC2
instance with another type than t2.micro</p>
<p>C.
James has created the instance without a key pair. He should launch the instance again by using a
key pair</p>
<p>D.
The EBS Volume limits in his account have been exceeded. He needs to submit a request to AWS to
increase the limit</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT. The error Client.InternalError: Client error on launch indicates various
  issues
  with the EBS Volumes. In this case, it is due to the lack of permissions to access KMS Keys to
  encrypt or decrypt the EBS Volumes. Since James has only the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy, it
  doesn’t
  include the required permissions for AWS KMS. That’s why James needs to have the permissions
  required to access the AWS KMS keys used to decrypt and encrypt volumes in order to resolve the
  issue of instance terminating immediately. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy provides full access to Amazon EC2.
  This policy is NOT limited to certain instance types. A user with this policy permissions can
  launch
  an EC2 instance of any type. So this is not a valid reason for the error mentioned in the
  question. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because there is no problem in proceeding without a key pair. It totally
  depends on a user’s requirement if he needs the key pair or not. You need to use a key pair when
  you
  want to connect it to your EC2 instance using SSH. When you are planning to connect to your
  instance
  using the console through the Instance Connect option, then you can proceed without a key pair
  also. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Although exceeding the EBS volume limit is one of the valid reasons for the
  instance to go into a terminated state immediately, the error Client.InternalError: Client error
  on
  launch indicates various issues with the EBS Volumes. In this case, it is due to the lack of
  permissions to access KMS Keys to encrypt or decrypt the EBS Volumes. <br />

<h4 id="question-52">Question 52</h4>
<p>You are designing an architecture for one of your client&rsquo;s applications. You created a VPC within
the us-east-1 region consisting of two public subnets and a private subnet. The first public subnet
contains a web server. All the other VPC Networking components are also set including Internet
gateway, route tables, security groups, etc. Your team lead reviewed the architecture and informed
you about the client’s requirement to make the current architecture highly available with MINIMAL
COST. He also specified that the client could accept a minor downtime, but the cost is the priority
here.</p>
<p>Which options can make your current architecture highly available with minimum effort and costs?</p>
<p>A.
Span the architecture components to a second Availability zone by creating similar resources in it
as AZ-1 and then distributing the traffic using an application load balancer</p>
<p>B.
Create a standby instance in the second public subnet. Attach a secondary ENI to the instance in the
first public subnet. In case of a failure, detach this ENI and attach it to the standby instance</p>
<p>C.
Span the architecture components to a second region by creating similar resources in it as available
in US-East-1 and then distributing the traffic using an application load balancer</p>

Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because having the resources in the second Availability zone and then using

  minimum, and the efforts also should be minimal. Due to these reasons, this option can be
  eliminated. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT. Creating a secondary ENI, and using it in case of instance failure by
  attaching
  it with a standby instance is the most cost-effective solution out of the four given options.
  Also,
  this solution doesn’t require much effort to set up. Thus, it can satisfy the requirement of
  building high availability in the architecture with a low cost and less effort. <br />
  <img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_22.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect because having the same resources in the second region will almost double
  the
  overall cost. Also, you can’t use an application load balancer to distribute the traffic across
  regions. It can distribute the traffic across Availability zones only. Since it is mentioned that
  cost should be kept to a minimum and the efforts also should be minimal, this option can be
  eliminated. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Although implementing dynamic scaling using the mentioned services will
  achieve high availability with zero downtime, it will increase the cost. And it is explicitly
  mentioned that the client can accept some downtime, but the cost should be minimal. That’s why
  this
  option can be eliminated. <br />

<p>You have launched an EC2 instance with a General Purpose EBS Volume of 16384 GB as its root volume (
/dev/xvda). After working on it for some time, you observed the need to have more storage with this
instance. You found a volume (/dev/xvdf1) available in your account. Therefore this volume is
attached as an additional volume with your EC2 instance.</p>
<p>One of your teammates informed you that this volume (/dev/xvdf1) was created from the snapshot of
the root volume of another instance. Later on, upon rebooting the instance, you connect to it and
observe that the instance has booted from /dev/xvdf1, whereas it was supposed to boot from
/dev/xvda (original root volume). What should you do now to resolve the problem and let the instance
boot from the correct volume?</p>
<p>A.
Keep the additional volume in an Availability zone other than the one where the EC2 instance and its
root volume reside, then attach it to the EC2 instance</p>
<p>B.
Change the label of the additional volume using the e2label command</p>

Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. This is not a valid solution because an EBS Volume needs to be present in
  the
  same Availability zone as the EC2 Instance with which you want to attach the volume. That’s why
  this
  option can be eliminated. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT. The instance is booting from the wrong volume because the additional volume
  that you have used with your instance was created from the root volume of another volume. This can
  lead to the wrong selection of volume during the instance boot. To solve this issue, you can use
  the
  e2label command to change the label of the attached volume that you do not want to boot
  from. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_23.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect. The maximum storage capacity of a General Purpose EBS Volume is 16384 GB (
  16
  TB). The questions specify that you have already provisioned this capacity to your volume during
  the
  instance creation. This means you can’t provision any more capacity to the volume. You need to
  attach an additional volume with your EC2 instance for more storage. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Although changing the label of the additional volume is the correct
  solution,
  the command mentioned in this option is incorrect. You will be able to change the label using the
  e2label command only. <br />

application is in the Japanese language. You can do so by specifying the IP address of that
particular server while configuring the records in Route 53. Which one of the following routing
policies should you use in Amazon Route 53 that will fulfill the given requirement?</p>

Weighted Routing Policy</p>
<p>B.
Geoproximity Routing Policy</p>
<p>C.
Geolocation Routing Policy</p>
<p>D.
Multivalue Answer Routing Policy</p>

    Explanation

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect. A Weighted Routing Policy is used when you have a requirement to specify
  the
  percentages of traffic to be routed to the underlying servers. For example, 10% traffic to Test
  Server A, 10% Traffic to Test Server B, and 80% Traffic to the Production server. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. If the requirement was to route the user request based on the location of
  the
  users as well as the servers, then you could use the Geoproximity routing policy. For example, you
  may want the user’s request should be routed to the resources present at the least distance from
  the
  user. Also, in this policy, You can optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given
  resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias will let you shrink or expand the size of
  a
  geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource. So let’s say there are 4 or 5 cities
  whose traffic you want to route to resources in 1 region and then another few cities whose
  requests
  you want to be routed to the resources in 2nd region. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. In the Geolocation policy, though the resources might be present close to the
  user, the request wants to go to another resource which is quite far. This happens because we want
  the user’s request from a location to be routed to a specific server or set of servers only where
  the correctly translated website was hosted. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Multivalue answer routing is used when you want to route the DNS queries
  randomly to the underlying servers. It will consider up to 8 healthy servers, and the request will
  be routed to any of them randomly. In this question, the requirement is for routing the DNS
  queries
  to a specific server which is why this option can be eliminated. <br />

Options A and B are incorrect because both of them mention the use of AWS Cloudtrail. We can use
Cloudtrail mostly when we want to record the API calls happening in our AWS Account. To monitor the
performance and utilization of resources and applications, Amazon Cloudwatch is used. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. Although using Amazon Cloudwatch is the right choice, the standard metrics
  in
  Cloudwatch cannot collect the ones mentioned in the question. To monitor the application logs and
  metrics like the percentage of total disk space that is used, the amount of memory currently in
  use,
  the percentage of time that the CPU is idle, etc. you need to capture Custom Metrics. This can be
  done using Cloudwatch Unified Agent. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT. The metrics mentioned in the question are not readily available in
  Cloudwatch.
  Using Cloudwatch unified agent on your on-premises servers, you can monitor the required Custom
  metrics and the application logs. You will need to capture disk_used_percent, mem_used_percent,
  and
  cpu_usage_idle metrics using Cloudwatch Unified Agent. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_25.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

You can use resource-based policies with Lambda functions to grant access to other AWS Accounts to
perform actions on a Lambda function in your account. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Although assigning a resource policy on your Lambda Function will give User
  B
  the required permissions, as per the Least Privilege Principle, we have always to assign only the
  least required permissions. lambda:* will give the permission to perform all the actions, whereas
  User B just needs permission for two actions. That’s why this option can be eliminated. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Although this is also a possible solution, it doesn’t fully satisfy the
  requirement mentioned in the question. When User B will assume a role in your account, he will be
  able to access the lambda function. But his normal permissions will be forgotten as long as he has
  assumed the role. It is explicitly mentioned in the question that User B should be able to perform
  his normal operations as well along with the required actions on Lambda. Also, this method will
  require more effort as compared to resource-based policies. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. Using a resource-based policy with the appropriate permissions for only
  required actions is the best choice here. Also, this method doesn’t need much effort as compared
  to
  granting access through the IAM role. lambda:InvokeFunction will let user B invoke the Lambda
  Function and lambda:GetFunction will let user B download the function code. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because creating an IAM User is unnecessary here. It is mentioned in the
  question that User B needs to run the function in his Account B. If you create one more IAM user
  in
  Account B, that user will have to login into Account A and perform the required actions there.
  This
  is opposite to what’s mentioned in the requirement. That’s why this option can be
  eliminated. <br />

<p>You have designed an architecture for a highly available web application with a dynamic workload.
This architecture consists of a set of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group and a load
balancer for the even distribution of traffic. Your manager has reviewed the functioning of this
architecture and is concerned about the latency of the scaling out process. Whenever there is a need
to scale out, it takes a few seconds to a few minutes for Auto Scaling to launch the instance,
register it with the load balancer, and start serving the requests. The Manager has asked you to
look for a way to reduce this latency so that instances can start serving the requests as quickly as
possible. Which of the following options can satisfy the given requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Use Warm Pool with Auto Scaling</p>
<p>B.
Use the Desired capacity parameter to scale out quickly</p>
<p>C.
Use Lifecycle hooks with Auto Scaling</p>
<p>D.
Use the Scheduled scaling type to scale out quickly</p>

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT. Auto Scaling Warm Pool is a collection of pre-initialized EC2 Instances
  sitting
  along with your Auto Scaling Group. So, when there’s a need to Scale Out, Auto Scaling will pick
  one
  of the instances from the Warm Pool, and that instance will immediately start serving the
  requests.
  This will eventually reduce the latency involved because of the time taken by a new instance to
  launch. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_26.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect. Desired Capacity is just a way to scale out or scale in manually. You
  specify
  a number in the desired capacity, and that number of EC2 instances will start to launch in your
  Auto
  Scaling Group immediately. This will have the latency for the time when the instance is launching.
  That’s why this option can be eliminated. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. Lifecycle hooks are used when you want your newly launched instances to
  wait
  and perform some custom actions on them before they start serving the requests. This won’t satisfy
  the given requirement of reducing latency and letting the instances serve the requests
  quickly. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Setting up Scheduled Scaling is not a good choice for the given scenario.
  It
  is mentioned in the question that the workload is dynamic which means there can be the need to
  scale
  out or scale in at any time. You can use Scheduled Scaling for the cases of predictable workloads
  where you know exactly when there is a need to scale out or scale in. <br />

for certain dynamic contents. Which of the following options is the most appropriate to achieve the
requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Modify the application to add a Cache-Control header to control how long the objects stay in the
CloudFront cache.</p>
<p>B.
In the CloudFront distribution, enlarge the default TTL in the object caching setting</p>

Correct Answer – A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: Because the Cache-Control header added by the origin server can be used to
  control the caching behavior in CloudFront. The application is responsible for adding the header
  for
  individual objects. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because the default TTL impacts all objects if the origin does not add the
  cache header. However, in the question, only certain dynamic contents need to be modified. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because the cache duration is not increased by setting the value of Minimum
  TTL to be 0. Please check the below reference on how to determine the amount of time that
  CloudFront
  keeps an object in the cache. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: The question mentions that the cache duration of dynamic contents needs to
  be
  increased. However, S3 objects belong to static contents. <br />

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – B <br />

- Option A is incorrect: Because OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity determines the percentages of
  On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances beyond OnDemandBaseCapacity. The value should be 100 in
  production as no Spot Instances should be used in production. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT: As the value of OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity is 0 in non-production,
  Spot Instances will be used. For the production environment, On-Demand Instances are launched as
  OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity is 100. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: SpotMaxPrice determines the maximum price that you are willing to pay for
  Spot Instances. It does not decide the percentage between Spot and On-Demand instances. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: In this scenario, OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity should be configured
  to
  launch Spot Instances in non-production and On-Demand Instances in production. <br />

<h4 id="question-60">Question 60</h4>
<p>You have built a serverless architecture composed of Lambda Functions exposed through API Gateway
for one of your client’s applications. For the database layer, you have used DynamoDB. Your team
lead has reviewed the architecture and is concerned about the cost of numerous API Calls being made
to the backend (Lambda Functions) for so many similar requests. Also, the client is concerned about
providing as low latency as possible for the application users’ requests. You have to look for a
solution where the latency and overall cost can be reduced for the current architecture without much
effort.</p>
<p>A.
Cache the computed request’s responses using the CloudFront CDN caching</p>
<p>B.
Use the API Gateway QuickResponse feature to reduce the latency and number of calls to the backend</p>
<p>C.
Enable API Gateway Caching to cache the computed request’s responses</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Cloudfront CDN caching is mainly used for caching the responses to limited
  HTTP requests. API Gateway can cache the responses to requests of any type. Also, configuring
  Cloudfront CDN would be an added effort. You have to select a solution with minimal effort.
  Therefore, this option can be eliminated. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because there is no feature like API Gateway QuickResponse. This option is
  just a distractor and thus, can be eliminated. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. When you enable caching on API Gateway, it caches the responses of the
  requests
  processed by the backend. When a similar request comes, it will serve it quickly from the API
  Gateway Cache itself instead of passing the call to the backend. This will reduce the number of
  calls made to the backend, eventually reducing the overall cost. Also, this will help in reducing
  the latency of the responses sent to the user. <br />
  <img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_27.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option D is incorrect. Throttling is used to limit the number of requests that can pass through
  API
  Gateway at a time. It is configured in API Gateway to protect your APIs from being overwhelmed by
  many requests at a time. This won’t satisfy the requirement of reducing the latency. Hence, this
  option can be eliminated.

<p>A.
DynamoDB Streams with AWS Lambda</p>

Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT. In the question, it is mentioned that a feature is needed where an action
  will
  be performed automatically in response to an event (HighestScore Update) in the Scores DynamoDB
  Table. DynamoDB Streams capture the changes happening in your DynamoDB Table. You just have to
  create a lambda function that will capture the updates from DynamoDB Streams and invoke the code
  to
  post the winner-related message on social media. This will satisfy the given requirement. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_28.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect. DynamoDB Global tables are useful when you want to have a multi-master,
  multi-region database without building a replication solution manually. In the current scenario,
  we
  need a solution to automate action in response to an event in the DynamoDB table. So, this option
  can be eliminated. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is useful when you need an in-memory caching
  solution with your DynamoDB Table. It will provide the response time in microseconds. It can’t
  satisfy the given requirement. Hence it can be eliminated. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. DynamoDB Transaction is a feature used primarily when you want to
  accomplish
  ACID Properties in your DynamoDB Table to maintain the correctness of data in your applications.
  This feature can’t satisfy the given requirement and hence can be eliminated. <br />

<p>A.
AWS Migration Hub</p>
<p>B.
Amazon Storage Gateway</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option A is incorrect because AWS Migration Hub comes into the picture when you are planning to
  migrate your application workloads from on-premises to AWS. In the question, we need a solution to
  migrate the object storage data from Google Cloud to Amazon S3 Bucket, which can't be satisfied
  using AWS Migration Hub. That's why we can eliminate this option. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Amazon Storage Gateway is used for hybrid storage requirements. This
  service
  is used when you want on-premises access to the storage on AWS. It is not useful for transferring
  the data from one cloud provider to another cloud provider. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. As per the documentation, “AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service
  that
  simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between storage systems and services.” All you
  need to do is create a DataSync agent, which is required to initiate the data transfer. DataSync
  agent is nothing but a Virtual Machine that will facilitate the data migration process. Then you
  can
  use the DataSync agent to migrate the data from Google cloud storage to Amazon S3 Bucket without
  writing any code or much effort. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. S3 Transfer Acceleration is used when you have large data to be sent to
  Amazon S3 buckets globally at a faster speed. It will integrate with Amazon CloudFront to speed up
  the data transfer. But AWS DataSync is a perfect choice for the given requirement. <br />

<p>A.
Use Savings Plans for the spiky traffic</p>
<p>B.
Use Spot Instances for the spiky traffic</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Savings plans are used for workloads with a steady or predictable usage.
  You
  can commit $/h usage of compute. Accordingly, you will get discounts on your compute prices. They
  are not suitable for spiky traffic. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT. Spot Instances in AWS are the unused EC2 instances capacity that AWS provides
  you at up to a 90% discounted rate as compared to the on-demand instances. <br />
  <img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_29.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

As per the information in the snippet, you can provision spot instances without much effort which
was another requirement in the question because now you don’t have to bid for the spot instance
prices. When AWS needs the capacity, they take it back from you with a 2-minute prior notice.
However, in this case, it is mentioned that the application is designed to recover from instance
failures. So interruption is not an issue. That’s why Spot instance would be the perfect choice in
this case because it is the cheapest option out of all others. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. On-Demand instances can be useful for spiky traffic, but it is mentioned in
  the question that the most cost-effective solution is needed. On-Demand instances are not
  cost-effective as compared to the other options mentioned here. Also, since it is mentioned that
  the
  application can recover from any failures, it means spot instance is the best choice here. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Dedicated Hosts are used when you need the EC2 instance capacity on
  a
  physical server dedicated just for your use. There is no such requirement, and moreover, dedicated
  hosts are a costly option. You have to select something cost-effective, and hence this option can
  be
  eliminated. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is CORRECT. You can use Amazon EFS replication to replicate your EFS file system within
  the
  same or a different region. This option doesn’t require much effort and can be configured easily
  with a few steps. It starts replication within minutes. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3_img_30.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-3" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect because there is no need to copy the EFS data to Amazon S3 for replicating
  it
  in another region. The required replication can be done very easily using Amazon EFS
  Replication. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. While it can transfer data between EFS file systems across regions, it
  requires more manual effort and is not as seamless as EFS Replication. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. AWS Direct Connect is used in the cases when you are working on a hybrid
  environment with on-premises and cloud included. You want them to be connected through a dedicated
  connection. Here we just have the requirement of replicating an EFS File system from one region to
  another. Hence this option can be eliminated. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Although AWS Directory Service for Microsoft AD provides all the high-level
  features, it is still a costly option as compared to the others mentioned in the options. In this
  question, it is mentioned that cost is the utmost priority. So, we can eliminate this option as
  this
  one would be expensive. It would be preferable when you need actual Microsoft AD on AWS. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Active Directory Connector is used when you want your on-premises users to
  use their existing active directory credentials to use AWS services. However, it is not required
  here. That’s why this option can be eliminated. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. Simple Active Directory will satisfy all the requirements mentioned in the
