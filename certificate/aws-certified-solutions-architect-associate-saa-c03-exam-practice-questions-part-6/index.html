		<h4 id="question-1">Question 1</h4>
<p>A manufacturing firm has a large number of smart devices installed in various locations worldwide.
Hourly logs from these devices are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Management is looking for
comprehensive dashboards which should incorporate usages of these devices and forecast usage trends
for these devices.</p>
<p>Which tool is the best suited to get this required dashboard?</p>
<p>A.
Use S3 as a source for Amazon QuickSight and create dashboards for usage and forecast trends</p>
<p>B.
Use S3 as a source for Amazon Redshift and create dashboards for usage and forecast trends</p>
<p>C.
Copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon DynamoDB. Use Amazon DynamoDB as a source for Amazon QuickSight
and create dashboards for usage and forecast trends</p>
<p>D.
Copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS. Use Amazon RDS as a source for Amazon QuickSight and create
dashboards for usage and forecast trends</p>

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

Amazon QuickSight is a business analytical tool that can be used to build visualizations and perform
ad-hoc analysis integrating with ML insights. It can connect to various data sources which can
either be in the AWS cloud or in the on-premises network or in any third-party applications. <br />
For AWS it supports various services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Redshift, Amazon
Athena, and Amazon S3 as sources. Based on this data, Amazon QuickSight creates custom dashboards
that include anomaly detections, forecasting, and auto-narratives. <br />
In the above case, logs from the devices are stored in Amazon S3. Amazon QuickSight can be used to
fetch this data, perform analysis, and generate comprehensive custom dashboards for device usage as
well as forecasting device usage. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6_img_1.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect as Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service for analyzing structured or
  semi-structured data. It is not a useful tool for creating dashboards. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon S3 can be used directly as a source for Amazon QuickSight. There
  is no need to copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon DynamoDB. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Amazon S3 can be used directly as a source for Amazon QuickSight. There
  is no need to copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS. <br />

<h4 id="question-2">Question 2</h4>
<p>A company has launched Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group for deploying a web
application. The Operations Team is looking to capture custom metrics for this application from all
the instances. These metrics should be viewed as aggregated metrics for all instances in an Auto
Scaling group.
What configuration can be implemented to get the metrics as required?</p>
<p>A.
Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics with detail monitoring enabled and send to CloudWatch console where
all the metrics for an Auto Scaling group will be aggregated by default.</p>
<p>B.
Install a unified CloudWatch agent on all Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group and use &quot;
aggregation_dimensions&quot; in an agent configuration file to aggregate metrics for all instances</p>
<p>C.
Install unified CloudWatch agent on all Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group and use
“append-config” in an agent configuration file to aggregate metrics for all instances</p>
<p>D.
Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics with detail monitoring enabled and create a single Dashboard to
display metrics from all the instances</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

Unified CloudWatch agent can be installed on Amazon EC2 instance for the following cases, <br />

The unified CloudWatch agent supports custom metric collection, and the "aggregation_dimensions"
configuration allows aggregation of metrics across instances in the Auto Scaling group, which meets
the requirement of viewing aggregated metrics. <br />
Collect custom metrics from the applications on the Amazon EC2 instance using StatsD and collectd
protocols. <br />
Collect logs from EC2 instances or from on-premises servers for both Windows and Linux OS. <br />
In the case of the Instances which are part of an Auto Scaling group, metrics from all the instances
can be aggregated using "aggregation_dimensions" in the agent configuration file. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as for retrieving custom level metrics for applications on an Amazon EC2
  Instance, a unified CloudWatch agent is required. Amazon CloudWatch metrics with detail monitoring
  will be capturing metrics every 1 minute but it won’t capture custom application metrics. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as the append-config configuration in an agent configuration file can be
  used to have multiple CloudWatch agent configuration files. This command is not suitable for
  aggregate metrics from all the instances in an Auto Scaling group. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as for retrieving custom-level metrics for applications on an Amazon EC2
  Instance, a unified CloudWatch agent is required. Dashboards can be used to create a customized
  view of the metrics, but they won’t aggregate metrics from the instance in an Auto Scaling
  Group. <br />

<h4 id="question-3">Question 3</h4>
<p>A critical web application is deployed on multiple Amazon EC2 instances which are part of an
Autoscaling group. One of the Amazon EC2 instances in the group needs to have a software upgrade.
The Operations Team is looking for your suggestions to advise for this upgrade without impacting
another instance in the group. Post upgrade, the same instance should be part of the Auto Scaling
group.</p>
<p>What steps can be initiated to complete this upgrade?</p>
<p>A.
Hibernate the instance and perform upgrade in offline mode. Post upgrade, start the instance which
will be part of the same auto-scaling group</p>
<p>B.
Use cooldown timers to perform upgrades on the instance. Post cooldown timers’ instances would be
part of the same auto-scaling group</p>
<p>C.
Put the instance in Standby mode. Post upgrade, move instance back to InService mode. It will be
part of the same auto-scaling group</p>
<p>D.
Use lifecycle hooks to perform upgrades on the instance. Once these timers expire, the instance
would be part of the same auto-scaling group</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group can be moved to Standby mode from InService mode. In
standby mode, software upgrade or troubleshooting can be performed on the instance. Post upgrade,
instances can be again put in InService mode back in the same Auto Scaling group. With instance in a
standby mode, Auto Scaling does not terminate this group as a part of health checks or scale-in
events. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Hibernate is not supported on an Amazon EC2 instance which is part of an
  Auto Scaling group. When an instance in an Auto Scaling group is hibernated, the Auto-scaling
  group marks the hibernated instance as unhealthy, terminates it, and launches a new instance.
  Hibernating an instance will not be useful for upgrading software on an instance. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as cooldown timers are the timers that will prevent launching or terminating
  instances in an Auto Scaling group till previous activities of launch or termination are
  completed. This timer provides a time for an instance to be in an active state before the Auto
  Scaling group adds a new one. This timer would not be useful for troubleshooting an
  instance. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as a Lifecycle hook can help to perform custom actions such as data backups
  before an instance is terminated or to perform software instances once an instance is launched.
  This hook is not useful for upgrading a running instance in an Auto Scaling Group and adding back
  to the original group. <br />

<h4 id="question-4">Question 4</h4>
<p>An eCommerce website is hosted on two EC2 instances that sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The
response time of the website has slowed dramatically. The analytics team found that one of the EC2
instances failed, leaving only one instance running. What is the best course of action to prevent
this from happening in the future?</p>
<p>A.
Change the instance size to the maximum available to compensate for the failure.</p>
<p>B.
Use CloudWatch to monitor the instances via VPC Flow Logs.</p>
<p>C.
Configure the ELB to perform health checks on the EC2 instances and implement auto-scaling.</p>
<p>D.
Replicate the existing configuration in several regions for failover</p>

    Explanation

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

- Option C is correct. Using the elastic load balancer to perform health checks will determine
  whether or not to remove a non- or underperforming instance and have the auto-scaling group launch
  a new instance. <br />
- Option A is incorrect because increasing the instance size doesn’t prevent the failure of one or
  both instances. Therefore the website can still become slow or unavailable. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because monitoring the VPC flow logs for the VPC will capture VPC traffic,
  not traffic for the EC2 instance. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because replicating the same two instance deployment may not prevent the
  failure of instances and could still result in the website becoming slow or unavailable. <br />

<h4 id="question-5">Question 5</h4>
<p>A third-party vendor based in an on-premises location needs to have temporary connectivity to
database servers launched in a single Amazon VPC. The proposed connectivity for these few users
should be secure, and access should be provided only to authenticated users.</p>
<p>Which connectivity option can be deployed for this requirement in the most cost-effective way?</p>
<p>A.
Deploy an AWS Client VPN from third-party vendor&rsquo;s client machines to access databases in Amazon VPC</p>
<p>B.
Deploy AWS Direct Connect connectivity from the on-premises network to AWS</p>
<p>C.
Deploy an AWS Managed VPN connectivity to a Virtual Private gateway from an on-premises network</p>
<p>D.
Deploy an AWS Managed VPN connectivity to the AWS Transit gateway from the on-premises network</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

AWS Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN for having secure access to resources in VPC as well as
resources in on-premises networks. Clients looking for access to these resources use an
OpenVPN-based VPN client. Access to resources in VPC is secure over TLS and clients are
authenticated before access is granted. <br />

In the above case, since third-party vendors from on-premises need secure temporary connectivity to
resources in VPC, AWS Client VPN can be used to provide this connectivity. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6_img_2.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option B is incorrect as since there are only a few users accessing resources from a single VPC
  for temporary purposes, using AWS Direct Connect will be costly and will require a longer time for
  deployment. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as using Managed VPN for a few users will be costlier than using AWS Client
  VPN for those few users accessing databases from VPC. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Connectivity to AWS Transit gateway will be useful for accessing
  resources from multiple VPCs. Also, since only a few users access resources from a single VPC for
  temporary purposes, AWS Client VPN is a cost-effective option. <br />

<h4 id="question-7">Question 7</h4>
<p>A company is using microservices-based applications using Amazon ECS for an online shopping
application. For different services, multiple tasks are created in a container using the EC2 launch
type. The security team is looking for some specific security controls for the tasks in the
containers along with granular network monitoring using various tools for each task.</p>
<p>What networking mode configuration can be considered with Amazon ECS to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Use host networking mode for Amazon ECS tasks</p>
<p>B.
By default, an elastic network interface (ENI) with a primary private IP address is assigned to each
task</p>
<p>C.
Use awsvpc networking mode for Amazon ECS tasks</p>
<p>D.
Use bridge networking mode for Amazon ECS tasks</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type supports the following networking mode, <br />

Host Mode: This is a basic mode in which the networking of the container is directly tied to the
underlying host. <br />
Bridge Mode: In this mode, a network bridge is created between host and container networking. This
bridge mode allows the remapping of ports between host and container ports. <br />
None mode: In this mode, networking is not attached to the container. With this mode, containers do
not have external connectivity. <br />
AWSVPC Mode: In this mode, each task is allocated a separate ENI (Elastic Network Interface). Each
Task will receive a separate IP address and a separate security group can be assigned to each ENI.
This helps to have separate security policies for each task and helps to get granular monitoring for
traffic flowing via each task. <br />
In the above scenario, using AWSVPC mode, the security team can assign different security policies
for each task as well as monitor traffic from each task distinctly. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as with host networking mode, networking of containers uses the network
  interface of the Amazon EC2 instance on which it's running. This is a basic network type and each
  task does not get assigned a different networking mode. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as an elastic network interface (ENI) with the primary private IP address is
  assigned for Fargate task networking, not for ECS task networking. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Bridge mode uses Docker’s built-in virtual network. Containers connected
  to the bridge can communicate with others. Containers using different bridges cannot communicate
  with each other while providing isolation. It does not provide each task with a separate
  networking mode that can be used for security controls and network monitoring. <br />

Correct Answer: D <br />

AWS Outpost extends AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises environments, which provides the
lowest latency when connecting from on-premises to AWS workloads. By deploying EC2 launch type with
Amazon ECS on AWS Outpost, the startup firm can leverage scalable EC2 instances that support high
CPU and memory requirements, while maintaining a low-latency connection to their on-premises
networks. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as the AWS Fargate launch type is not supported with Amazon ECS deployed in
  the AWS Outpost. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as the AWS Fargate launch type is not supported with Amazon ECS deployed in
  the AWS Local Zone. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as with AWS Local Zones, other services such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon
  FSx file servers, and Application Load Balancers need to be implemented before deploying Amazon
  ECS in the Local Zones. With AWS Outposts, native AWS services and infrastructure is enabled which
  makes it an ideal choice for low latency from on-premises networks. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: D <br />

This is the correct and most recommended solution. Gateway endpoints are specifically designed for
Amazon S3 and DynamoDB and allow secure, private connectivity from resources in a VPC without
requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN. They ensure that traffic to these services
remains within the AWS network, enhancing both security and performance. Additionally, gateway
endpoints are cost-effective and easy to manage, making them ideal for scenarios where secure and
scalable access to S3 and DynamoDB is required from private subnets. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. While using a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB is appropriate, using an
  interface endpoint for Amazon S3 is not. Amazon S3 is one of the two AWS services (along with
  DynamoDB) that supports gateway endpoints, not interface endpoints. Interface endpoints are based
  on AWS PrivateLink and are used for services like Secrets Manager, SSM, and others that do not
  support gateway endpoints. Therefore, this configuration would not provide the intended private
  connectivity to S3 and would not meet the requirement of avoiding internet traversal. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as a private NAT gateway can be used to have communication between VPCs or
  with on-premises networks. It is not an option to have communication from a private subnet in a
  VPC to an Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as with a public NAT Gateway, traffic will traverse over the
  Internet. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

CORS (Cross Origin resource sharing) is a configuration that allows web applications deployed in one
domain to interact with applications in different domains. Enabling CORS on an S3 bucket selectively
allows content in the S3 bucket to be accessed. <br />

In the above scenario, when CORS is not enabled, JavaScript will not be able to access content in
the S3 bucket using the S3 API endpoint. To allow this access, CORS configuration using JSON needs
to be created and added to the S3 bucket from the S3 console. <br />

CORS can be enabled with the following settings, <br />

Access-Control-Allow-Origin <br />
Access-Control-Allow-Methods <br />
Access-Control-Allow-Headers <br />
For successful access, Origin, Methods, and Headers from the requestor should match the values
defined in the configuration files. In the above scenario, the GET method should be added to the
CORS configuration file. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as for GET requests, Access-Control-Allow-Methods should be defined in the
  configuration file and not the Access-Control-Allow-Headers. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as CORS configuration with XML is not supported while configuring CORS using
  the S3 console. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as for GET request, Access-Control-Allow-Methods should be defined in the
  configuration file and not the Access-Control-Allow-Headers. CORS configuration with XML is not
  supported while configuring CORS using the S3 console. <br />

Correct Answer: C <br />

When an S3 bucket policy is created with permission granting only to the roles, specific users
assuming this role can be able to access this bucket. <br />

Users having an IAM policy with full access to the Amazon S3 bucket will be denied access to the
Amazon S3 bucket with this bucket policy. This bucket policy can be implemented using “Condition” in
a policy statement. <br />

When new users with full access granted by IAM policy are created, there is a need to modify S3
bucket policy which grants access based upon users. When a bucket policy is created using roles,
additional maintenance work of modifying bucket policy is not required. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as any new users or roles who are granted IAM users’ policy of full access
  to the Amazon S3, will be able to access all the Amazon S3 buckets even though there is explicit
  denial. This approach will require additional admin work to update the bucket policy. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as any new users who are granted full access to the Amazon S3 will be able
  to access all the Amazon S3 buckets even though there is explicit denial. This approach will
  require additional admin work to update the bucket policy. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as Roles consist of two ARN: role ARN and assume-role ARN. Assume-role ARN
  is a variable name that should be matched using wildcard values and is not allowed with the
  NotPrincipal element. <br />

Amazon ECS Cluster with Fargate launch type automatically provisions resources such as Amazon EC2 as
per application demands. It automatically handles cluster optimization without any manual
intervention. <br />

Amazon Aurora Serverless is a relational database that provides on-demand auto-scaling database
configuration. For both Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type and Aurora Serverless, there is no need
to manage the underlying infrastructure and is scalable to application demands. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Amazon DynamoDB is best suited for NO-SQL databases, not for relational

- Option C is incorrect as with EC2 launch type, users need to manually provision Amazon EC2
  instances in ECS clusters as per growing demands. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as with EC2 launch type, users need to manually provision Amazon EC2
  instances in ECS clusters as per growing demands. Amazon DynamoDB is best suited for a NoSQL

Correct Answer: A <br />

Instance Metadata consists of datas like instance-id, AMI ID, public hostname, IPv4 address, etc
which is available from the running Amazon EC2 instances. <br />

URL http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ can be used to get these details from the running
instance. There are no charges for retrieving these details. There is no need to use the EC2 console
or CLI for getting these details. To get the AMI ID for the running

- Option B is incorrect as IP address 168.254.168.254 is invalid to retrieve meta-data or dynamic
  data. Correct IP address is 169.254.169.254 <br />
- Option C is incorrect as user-data can be used to specify parameters or add configuration files

Correct Answers: B and C <br />

You can share your file data sets across multiple applications, internal organizations, or
environments spanning multiple VPCs, accounts, or Regions using inter-VPC, inter-account, and
inter-Region access. <br />

Single-AZ files ensure high availability within a single Availability Zone (AZ) by automatically
detecting and addressing component failures. In addition, Multi-AZ file systems provide high
availability and failover support across multiple Availability Zones by provisioning and maintaining
a standby file server in a separate Availability Zone within an AWS Region. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because those benefits are part of the AWS Global Accelerator networking
  service. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Direct Connect or VPN (on-premises) and VPC Peering or AWS Transit
  Gateway are supported. <br />
- Option E is incorrect because Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is not POSIX-compliant —Amazon
  FSx for Luster is POSIX-compliant. <br />

<p>While analyzing billions of web pages in a company, you have noticed some munging processes are
exceeding SLAs even after using X1e instances suitable for HPC applications. After monitoring logs,
trailing, and tracing data closely, you noticed that write operations involving S3 content
pre-processing causing 80% of the bottleneck. In comparison, read operations for post-processing and
LIST operations are together leading to the remaining 20% of congestion. Which two options are
recommended to increase performance in this scenario? (Select TWO)</p>
<p>A.
Migrate S3 files to an RDS database with write-optimized IOPS.</p>
<p>B.
Using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration, Multipart upload, parallelized reading via byte-range
fetches, and partitioned prefix for distributing key names as part of naming patterns.</p>
<p>C.
Instead of LIST operations, you can scale storage connections horizontally since Amazon S3 is a very
large distributed system similar to a decoupled parallel, single network endpoint. You can achieve
the best performance by issuing multiple concurrent requests to Amazon S3.</p>
<p>D.
Instead of LIST operations, you can build a search catalog to keep track of S3 metadata by using
other AWS services like Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon OpenSearch Service.</p>
<p>E.
Combining Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 instances by migrating your current buckets to the region where
the instances are available. This will help to reduce network latency and data transfer costs.</p>

Answers: B and D <br />

The problem description highlights write operations having 80% of the impact when compared to read
operations. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration helps especially in this scenario along with multipart
upload. <br />

X1 and X1e instances are memory-optimized instances designed for running large-scale and in-memory
applications in the AWS Cloud. <br />

Generally, it is a recommended practice to benefit from byte-range fetches and appropriate
distributing key names. Another complex practice to avoid expensive LIST operations relies on a
search framework to keep track of all objects in an S3 bucket. <br />

Lambda triggers are used to populate DynamoDB tables with object names and metadata when those
objects are put into Amazon S3 then OpenSearch Service is used to search for specific assets,
related metadata, and data classifications. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6_img_6.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect because this option is not applicable as you would need to migrate the data
  to a relational database in RDS. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because the phrase does not make sense, especially considering that the
  Amazon S3 service is exactly the opposite of a single network endpoint. <br />
- Option E is incorrect because you cannot migrate an existing S3 bucket into another AWS Region,
  rather create a new S3 bucket in the region and copy the data to it. However, the statement does
  not solve the problem description. <br />

<p>A.
Amazon Neptune</p>
<p>B.
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)</p>
<p>C.
Amazon ElastiCache</p>
<p>D.

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) is the most suitable option for the logistics company's
requirements: <br />

Immutable Transaction History: QLDB provides a fully managed, serverless, and scalable ledger
database service designed specifically to maintain a complete and verifiable history of all changes
to application data. <br />
Real-time Visibility into Data Changes: QLDB allows for real-time visibility into data changes with
its ability to provide an immutable history of all transactions. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service designed
  for storing and querying highly connected data, such as social networks or recommendation engines.
  It does not provide the built-in features necessary for maintaining an immutable transaction
  history <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service that
  provides high-performance, scalable caching solutions. However, it is not designed to maintain
  immutable transaction history or provide real-time visibility into data changes. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service designed
  for high-performance, low-latency applications. It does not provide built-in features for
  maintaining immutable transaction history or real-time visibility into data changes. While
  DynamoDB Streams can capture changes to data, it does not offer the same level of immutability and
  verifiability as Amazon QLDB. <br />

Answer: B <br />

The cooldown period is the amount of time to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect is
called the cooldown period. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because the CloudWatch alarm is already triggered so wrong CloudWatch metric
  does not cause the problem. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because under the cooldown period, scaling activities will not be
  triggered. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because this option will not stop the ASG from adding/deleting
  instances. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because with the option, the ASG can still add/delete instances by adjusting

Correct Answer: D <br />

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams is specifically designed for handling live video streams at scale,
providing features like automatic scaling, data retention policies, and integration with other AWS
services for real-time analytics and processing. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Amazon Elastic Transcoder is primarily used for transcoding media
  files from one format to another. It does not provide real-time analysis capabilities required for
  detecting suspicious activities and intrusions in surveillance camera footage. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because Amazon Rekognition Video is a service for analyzing video content to
  detect objects, activities, and persons of interest, but it is not designed for ingesting and
  processing live video streams from multiple cameras in real-time. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon SageMaker is a managed service for building, training, and

Correct Answer – D <br />

- Option A is incorrect because there is no such configuration to enable rotation for all secrets.
  The rotation is managed in each secret. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the CloudWatch Event rule needs a Lambda function as its target to
  check if rotation is enabled. The description of the option is incomplete. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Amazon GuardDuty, as a continuous security monitoring service, does
  not check the secret rotation for Secrets Manager. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT because the AWS Config rule “secretsmanager-rotation-enabled-check” checks
  whether AWS Secrets Manager secret has rotation enabled. Users need to add the rule in AWS Config
  and set up a notification. <br />

You can use a crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with tables. This is the primary method
used by most AWS Glue users. A crawler can crawl multiple data stores in a single run. Upon
completion, the crawler creates or updates one or more tables in your Data Catalog. The AWS Glue
Data Catalog can then be used to guide ETL operations. <br />

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6_img_8.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect because the table in AWS Glue is used to define the data schema. It is not
  the correct component to perform the ETL jobs. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because the table in Athena is not the correct component to populate the AWS
  Glue Data Catalog. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT because, in AWS Glue, you can use a Crawler that connects to the DynamoBD
  table and populates the Data Catalog. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Classifier is a component in Crawler that generates a schema. You
  should use Crawler to perform the ETL jobs instead of Classifier. The classifier is not a separate
  component. <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports changes to the data record retention period of your data
stream. A Kinesis data stream is an ordered sequence of data records meant to be written to and read
from in real-time. Data records are therefore stored in shards in your stream temporarily. The time
period from when a record is added to when it is no longer accessible is called the retention
period. A Kinesis data stream stores record from 24 hours by default, up to 8760 hours (365
days). <br />

- Option A is incorrect, even though a possibility cannot be considered the right option. <br />
- Option B is incorrect since S3 can store data indefinitely unless you have a lifecycle policy
  defined. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because the Kinesis service is perfect for this sort of data
  ingestion. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

To back up the AWS CloudHSM data to Amazon S3 buckets in the same region, AWS CloudHSM generates a
unique Ephemeral Backup Key (EBK) to encrypt all data using AES 256-bit encryption key. This
Ephemeral Backup Key (EBK) is further encrypted using Persistent Backup Key (PBK), which is also an
AES 256-bit encryption key. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as AWS CloudHSM does not use data Key & Customer Managed Key to encrypt
  data, instead of that EBK & PBK are used. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. While taking the backup of data from different AWS CloudHSM clusters to the
  Amazon S3 bucket, the Amazon S3 bucket should be in the same region as that of the AWS CloudHSM
  cluster. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as AWS CloudHSM does not use data Key & Customer Managed Key to encrypt

The AWS Documentation mentions the following. <br />

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. You can
start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more. This enables you to
use your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers. <br />

Although Kinesis has capabilities for analyzing & transforming streaming data, the question refers
to having a data store for storing data from different applications BI, Reporting …which is where a
Data Lake or Data Warehouse solutions come into the picture. Kinesis would be more appropriate in
situations where one needs to process streaming data. <br />

Amazon Redshift supports client connections with many types of applications, including business
intelligence (BI), reporting, data, and analytics tools. <br />

- Option A is incorrect since DynamoDB is used for NoSQL datastore. <br />
- Option C is incorrect since Kinesis is used for analyzing & transforming streaming data. <br />

Correct Answer - A <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following to support this requirement. <br />

Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources differently, for example, by purpose, owner, or
environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type — you can quickly identify
a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. <br />

Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could
define a set of tags for your account's Amazon EC2 instances that help you track each instance's
owner and stack level. <br />

We recommend you to devise a set of tag keys that will meet your needs for each resource type. Using
a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and
filter the resources based on the tags you add. <br />

The backend nodes can scale based on the queue length. Check the reference in
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-loosely-coupled-scalable-c-applications-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-sns/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-loosely-coupled-scalable-c-applications-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-sns/</a> <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible describes the number of messages available
  for retrieval. It can be used to decide the queue length. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because NumberOfMessagesReceived is the number of messages returned by
  calls to the ReceiveMessage action. It does not measure the queue length. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because NumberOfMessagesDeleted is the number of messages deleted from the

Correct Answers: A and D <br />

Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for database (DB) instances.
This replication feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a
single DB Instance for read-heavy database workloads. <br />

For more information on Read Replicas, please refer to the link below: <br />

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/</a> <br />

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory
data store or cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by
allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory data stores instead of relying
entirely on slower disk-based databases. <br />

For more information on ElastiCache, please refer to the link below. <br />

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/</a> <br />

- Option B is incorrect because it is not an ideal way to scale a database. Amazon RDS storage Auto
  Scaling is to scale the storage capacity. If the storage capacity threshold is reached, then
  capacity will be scaled through storage Auto Scaling. <br />
  RDS storage auto scaling does not look for the CPU utilization threshold. So it cannot be a
  solution for bottlenecks to read heavy databases. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. When there is a need for queue management of processing messages, then we

Correct Answer – B <br />

AWS SNS can push notifications to the related SQS endpoints. SNS uses a publish/subscribe model that
provides instant event notifications for applications. <br />

- Option A is incorrect: Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service, which is not suitable for
  this scenario. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT: Because SNS uses Pub/Sub messaging to provide asynchronous event
  notifications. Please check the link-
  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pub-sub-messaging/">https://aws.amazon.com/pub-sub-messaging/</a> <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because SQS does not use the publish/subscribe model. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: AWS Step Functions coordinate application components using visual
  workflows. The service should not be used in this scenario. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

Amazon S3 object lock should be enabled to store objects using the write once and read many (WORM)
models. The reference can be found in
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html</a> <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: After the S3 object lock is enabled, you can prevent the S3 objects from
  being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because versioning does not prevent objects from being deleted or
  modified. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because the S3 bucket should still allow the write operation. Otherwise,
  new objects cannot be saved in the bucket. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because there is no such configuration in Access Control List (ACL). <br />

Correct Answer – C, E <br />

- Option A is incorrect: Because users are charged based on the number of requests and the time it
  takes for the code to execute. The programming language does not directly determine the
  cost. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because the Lambda function handler does not impact the monthly cost at
  all. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT: Because the duration price depends on the amount of memory allocated to the
  function. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because the timeout value is not a direct factor in calculating the price.
  Please check the below reference for details. <br />
- Option E is CORRECT: Because the Lambda function charges you based on the number of requests, such
  as $0.20 per 1M requests. <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

The question clearly says that archived objects are no longer required one year after being created.
So in total objects expiry should be kept to 365 days. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because users cannot configure a rule to place delete markers in S3
  Glacier. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because users can configure the object expiration in the S3 life cycle, Amazon
  S3 will remove the expired objects. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because cleaning up expired object delete markers does not expire the
  objects. This action does not save costs. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because S3 Glacier Deep Archive does not automatically delete
  objects. <br />

<p>A.
Use Amazon Athena to query logs saved in Amazon S3 buckets.</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon S3 console to process logs.</p>

Correct Answer – A <br />

Amazon Athena is a suitable tool for querying Network Load Balancers logs. In the above case, since
a large amount of logs are saved in S3 buckets from the Network load balancer, Amazon Athena can be
used to query logs and generate required details of client IP address and TLS handshake time. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as processing many logs directly from the S3 console will be a
  time-consuming process. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as using a third-party tool will not be a cost-effective solution. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as in the above case, we require only details of Client IP details along
  with TLS handshake time for troubleshooting purposes. Amazon QuickSight will be useful in case you
  need data visualization. <br />

Correct Answer – D <br />

S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently
accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is appropriate for a
wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution,
mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as the Instance store will provide low latency access from EC2 instances,
  but it’s a temporary storage option. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Since this data would be accessed globally, Amazon EFS will not be ideal
  for this requirement. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon EBS volumes would be useful storage for single Amazon EC2
  instances. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: C <br />

Options A and B are incorrect because the Security Groups block traffic by default. You can use
NACLs as an additional security layer for the subnet to deny traffic. <br />

- Option D is incorrect since just changing the Inbound Rules is sufficient. <br />

The following are the characteristics of security groups: <br />

You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules. <br />
You can specify separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic. <br />
Security group rules enable you to filter traffic based on protocols and port numbers. <br />
Security groups are stateful — if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for
that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed
inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules. <br />

A Network Access Control List (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a
firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs
with rules similar to your security groups to add an additional layer of security to your
VPC. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT. Use signed cookies in the following cases to provide access to multiple
  restricted files. For example, all the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the
  subscribers' area of the website. You don't want to change your current URLs. <br />

- Option B is incorrect.CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide the same basic
  functionality, and they allow users to control who can access the content. <br />

Use signed URLs in the following cases. <br />

You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your
application- <br />
Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn't support
cookies. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because S3 pre-signed URLs won’t provide access without changing current
  links. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because the CloudFront geographic restrictions feature is used to prevent
  users in specific countries from accessing your content, but there is no such requirement in the

Correct Answer – A <br />

Amazon ElastiCache provides a scalable faster approach to cache data which can be used with both
SQL/NoSQL databases. These can be used to save application data, significantly improving latency &
throughout the application, and offloading load on back-end database servers. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as a Multi-AZ replica is used for data redundancy. It is not used to share
  the read traffic. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as Amazon CloudFront is more suitable for website caching & not for
  application caching. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as this would provide a faster lookup of data, but it’s not scalable. <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Amazon cloud watch dashboards can help to monitor all the resources. You
  can have a single view and multiple view across all the AWS regions to see how things are going
  across the services. But it cannot give detailed debugging and monitoring of each service. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because a cloud watch event is created if any event happens in service and
  can not be used for detailed analysis and debugging. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT as AWS X-ray collects data, analysis, and debugs of microservice applications.
  Amazon X-Ray helps to analyze and debug modern applications. It will also collect the traces of
  the request from each of the applications. It also records the traces. After recording, it can
  create a view service map that can be seen to trace data latency and analyze the issues. <br />
  Insights feature helps to create notifications that alert your team in real-time. Notifications
  help respond more quickly when troubleshooting is required, thus improving application
  availability. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Any custom monitoring tool will not help for detailed debugging of any
  microservices applications running on AWS. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

If your compute environment contains compute resources, but your jobs don't progress beyond
the <br />
<strong>RUNNABLE</strong> <br />
status, then there is something preventing the jobs from actually being placed on a compute
resource. Here are some common causes for this issue: <br />

The <br />
<strong>awslogs</strong> <br />
log driver isn't configured on your compute resources <br />
Insufficient resources <br />
No internet access for compute resources <br />
Amazon EC2 instance limit reached <br />

- Option A is correct as this is one of the reasons which is preventing the jobs from actually being
  placed on a compute resource. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as AWS Batch supports both customized AMI and Amazon ECS-optimized AMI. This
  is not a reason for Job being stuck in the Runnable state. <br />

- Option C is incorrect as a Job moves into a Runnable state only after all dependencies are
  processed. If there are any dependencies, Job stays in the Pending state, not the Runnable
  state. <br />

- Option D is incorrect as Compute resource can be an On-Demand Instance or a Spot Instance. In the
  question, it is given that the application has enough memory/CPU resources, so this is not a
  reason for Job being stuck in the Runnable state. <br />

The AWS Documentation mentions the following. <br />

Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can
get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Amazon Kinesis offers key capabilities to
cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale, along with the flexibility to choose the tools
that best suit the requirements of your application. <br />

With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website
clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications. Amazon
Kinesis enables you to process and analyze data as it arrives and responds instantly instead of
having to wait until all your data is collected before the processing can begin. <br />

- Option A is incorrect Amazon EMR is used for big data processing using tools like Apache Hadoop,
  Spark, and others, but it is not specifically designed for real-time data ingestion or stream

You can create multiple Job queues with different priorities & mapped Compute environments to each
Job queue. When Job queues are mapped to the same compute environment, queues with higher priority
are evaluated first. <br />

Options A and D are incorrect because a Single queue will not provide the solution for a mix of EC2
On-Demand & Spot instances. The same single queue cannot have high priority and low priority at the
same time. <br />

- Option C is incorrect as the Priority for a Job queue is selected in descending order. A higher

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer – C <br />

For a volume to be available in another availability zone, you need to create a snapshot from the
volume. Then in the snapshot from creating a volume, you can then specify the new availability zone
accordingly. <br />

The EBS Volumes attached to the EC2 Instance will always have to remain in the same availability
zone as the EC2 Instance. A possible reason for this could be because EBS Volumes are present
outside of the host machine, and instances have to be connected over the network. If the EBS Volumes
are present outside the Availability Zone, there can be potential latency issues and subsequent
performance degradation. <br />

What one can do in such a scenario is to get the Snapshot of the EBS Volume. Snapshot sequentially
captures the state of your EBS Volume. You can create an EBS Volume from this snapshot in your
desired Availability Zone and attach it to your new Instance. <br />

Later you can detach the volume from the older instance and delete then.

<img src="/images/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6_img_18.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-6" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is invalid because the Instance and Volume have to be in the same AZ to be attached to
  the instance. After all, we have to specify AZ while creating Volume. <br />
- Option B is invalid because there is no way to specify a volume as a source. <br />
- Option D is invalid because the Diskcopy would be a tedious process. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that can be attached to an Amazon EC2 instance
to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and High Performance Computing (
HPC) applications. <br />

EFA (EFA with ENA) interfaces provide both ENA devices for IP networking and EFA devices for
low-latency, high-throughput communication. <br />

EFA-only interfaces support only the EFA device capabilities, without the ENA device for traditional
IP networking. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as it is one of the features of EFA. <br />

- Option B is correct because it is one of the limitations of EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter). <br />

- Option C is incorrect because it is a true feature. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because it is also a feature. EFA integrates with Libfabric 1.7.0 and later.
  It supports Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL) for AI and ML applications, Open MPI 4
  and later, and Intel MPI 2019 Update 5 and later for HPC applications. <br />

<h4 id="question-64">Question 64</h4>
<p>A global media firm is using AWS CodePipeline as an automation service for releasing new features to
customers with periodic checks in place. All the codes are uploaded in the Amazon S3 bucket. Changes
in files stored in the S3 bucket should trigger AWS CodePipeline that will further initiate AWS
Elastic Beanstalk for deploying additional resources. What is the additional requirement that should
be configured to trigger CodePipeline in a faster way?</p>
<p>A.
Enable periodic checks and create a Webhook which triggers pipeline once S3 bucket is updated.</p>
<p>B.
Disable periodic checks, create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule &amp; AWS CloudTrail trail.</p>
<p>C.
Enable periodic checks, create an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule &amp; AWS CloudTrail trail.</p>
<p>D.
Disable periodic checks and create a Webhook which triggers pipeline once S3 bucket is updated.</p>

Correct Answer – B <br />

To automatically trigger pipeline with changes in the source S3 bucket, Amazon CloudWatch Events
rule & AWS CloudTrail trail must be applied. When there is a change in the S3 bucket, events are
filtered using AWS CloudTrail & then Amazon CloudWatch events are used to trigger the start of the
pipeline. This default method is faster & periodic checks should be disabled to have events-based
triggering of CodePipeline. <br />

You can use the following tools to monitor your CodePipeline pipelines and their resources: <br />

Amazon CloudWatch Events — Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to pipeline execution
state changes (for example, send an Amazon SNS notification or invoke a Lambda function). <br />
AWS CloudTrail — Use CloudTrail to capture API calls made by or on behalf of CodePipeline in your
AWS account and deliver the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. You can choose to have CloudWatch
publish Amazon SNS notifications when new log files are delivered so you can take quick
action. <br />
Console and CLI — you can use the CodePipeline console and CLI to view details about the status of a
pipeline or a particular pipeline execution. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Webhooks are used to trigger pipeline when the source is GitHub
  repository. Also, the periodic check will be a slower process to trigger CodePipeline. <br />

- Option C is incorrect as Periodic checks are not a faster way to trigger CodePipeline. <br />

- Option D is incorrect as Webhooks are used to trigger pipeline when the source is GitHub
  repository. <br />

<h4 id="question-65">Question 65</h4>
<p>You are working as an AWS Architect for a retail company using AWS EC2 instance for a web
application. The company is using Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volumes to store all product database.</p>
<p>This is a critical database &amp; you need to ensure appropriate backups are accomplished every 12
hours. Also, you need to ensure that storage space is optimally used for storing all these snapshots
removing all older files. Which of the following can help to meet this requirement with the least
management overhead?</p>
<p>A.
Manually create snapshots &amp; delete old snapshots for EBS volumes as this is a critical data.</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon CloudWatch events to initiate AWS Lambda which will create snapshot of EBS volumes along
with deletion of old snapshots.</p>
<p>C.
Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to schedule EBS snapshots and delete old snapshots as per
retention policy.</p>
<p>D.
Use Third party tool to create snapshot of EBS volumes along with deletion of old snapshots.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – C <br />

Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager can be used for creation, retention & deletion of EBS snapshots. It
protects critical data by initiating backup of Amazon EBS volumes at selected intervals, along with
storing & deletion of old snapshots to save storage space & cost. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as this will result in additional admin work & there can be a risk of losing
  critical data due to manual errors. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as for this we will need to do additional config changes in CloudWatch & AWS
  Lambda. Also, AWS Lambda would need a script to create snapshots which can be an overhead <br />

- Option D is incorrect as this will result in an additional cost to maintain a third-party
  software. <br />
