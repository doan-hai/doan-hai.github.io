		<h4 id="question-1">Question 1</h4>
<p>A start-up firm has created a cloud storage application that gives users the ability to store any
amount of personal data &amp; share them with their connections. For this, they are using Amazon S3
buckets to store user data. The firm has used Amazon S3 multipart upload to upload large objects in
parts. During the last quarter, the finance team has observed a surge in storage costs for the S3
bucket. On further checking, the firm observed that many 100 GB files are uploaded by users &amp; are in
a partially completed state.
As an AWS consultant, the IT Team requests you prevent this from happening again. Which of the
following actions can be taken to meet this requirement cost-effectively with the least effort?</p>
<p>A.
Create an S3 lifecycle Configuration to abort incomplete multipart uploads.</p>
<p>B.
Manually delete incomplete multipart uploads from the S3 bucket.</p>
<p>C.
Use Cron tool to identify incomplete uploads &amp; delete those files.</p>
<p>D.
No action is required. All Incomplete uploads are automatically deleted every three months by Amazon
S3.</p>

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – A <br />

Amazon S3 Lifecycle rules can be configured to abort all multipart uploads which are failing to
complete in a specific time period. For all files from size 5 MB to 5GB, the multipart upload can be
used. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as this will need additional manual efforts. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as this incurs additional cost & admin work to use Cron tools. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as incomplete uploads are not automatically deleted. <br />

<h4 id="question-2">Question 2</h4>
<p>Your Operations department is using an incident-based application hosted on a set of EC2 Instances.
These instances are placed behind an Auto Scaling Group to ensure that the right number of instances
are in place to support the application. The Operations department has expressed dissatisfaction
concerning poor application performance every day at 9:00 AM. However, it is also noted that the
system performance returns to optimal at 9:45 AM.</p>
<p>What could be done to fix this issue?</p>
<p>A.
Create another Dynamic Scaling Policy to ensure that the scaling happens at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>B.
Add another Auto Scaling group to support the current one.</p>
<p>C.
Change the Cool Down Timers for the existing Auto Scaling Group.</p>
<p>D.
Add a Scheduled Scaling Policy at 8:30 AM.</p>

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - D <br />

Scheduled Scaling can be used to ensure that the capacity is peaked before 9:00 AM every day. <br />

AWS Documentation further mentions the following on Scheduled Scaling: <br />

Scaling based on a schedule allows you to scale your application in response to predictable load
changes. For example, every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on
Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can plan your scaling
activities based on the predictable traffic patterns of your web application. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because a scheduled scaling should be used as per the requirements of the
  question instead of dynamic scaling. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because adding another autoscaling group will not solve the problem. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because changing the cooldown timers of the existing autoscaling group will
  not meet the requirements of the question. <br />

<p>You have created an AWS Lambda function that will write data to a DynamoDB table. Which of the
following must be in place to ensure that the Lambda function can interact with the DynamoDB table?</p>
<p>A.
Ensure an IAM Role is attached to the Lambda function which has the required DynamoDB privileges.</p>
<p>B.
Ensure an IAM User is attached to the Lambda function which has the required DynamoDB privileges.</p>
<p>C.
Ensure the Access keys are embedded in the AWS Lambda function.</p>

    >
    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – A <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following to support this requirement: <br />

Each Lambda function has an IAM role (execution role) associated with it. You specify the IAM role
when you create your Lambda function. Permissions you grant to this role determine what AWS Lambda
can do when it assumes the role. There are two types of permissions that you grant to the IAM
role: <br />

Suppose your Lambda function code accesses other AWS resources, such as reading an object from an S3
bucket or writing logs to CloudWatch Logs. In that case, you need to grant permissions for relevant
Amazon S3 and CloudWatch actions to the role. <br />
If the event source is stream-based (Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB streams), AWS Lambda
polls these streams on your behalf. AWS Lambda needs permissions to poll the stream and read new
records on the stream. So you need to grant the relevant permissions to this role. <br />

- Option B is incorrect. IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or
  application. 'IAM users get attached to a Lambda function' is an irrelevant sentence. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. Access keys are used to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS
  API.
  Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key like a user name and
  password. It is not a secure practice to add keys in the Lambda function. <br />

- Option D is incorrect. IAM user passwords should never be embedded in the Lambda function. Rather
  you can use environment variables to store secrets securely for use with Lambda functions. <br />

<h4 id="question-4">Question 4</h4>
<p>A Media firm is saving all its old videos in S3 Glacier Deep Archive. Due to the shortage of new
video footage, the channel has decided to reuse all these old videos. Since these are old videos,
the channel is not sure of their popularity &amp; response from users. Channel Head wants to make sure
that these huge size files do not shoot up their budget. For this, as an AWS consultant, you advise
them to use the S3 intelligent storage class. The Operations Team is concerned about moving these
files to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Which of the following actions can be taken to
move objects in Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class?</p>
<p>A.
Use Amazon S3 Console to copy these objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive to the required S3
Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon S3 Glacier Console to restore objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive &amp; then copy these
objects to the required S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.</p>
<p>C.
Use Amazon S3 console to restore objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive &amp; then copy these objects to

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – C <br />

To move objects from Glacier Deep Archive to different storage classes, first, need to restore them
to original locations using the Amazon S3 console & then use the lifecycle policy to move objects to
the required S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. <br />

Options A & D are incorrect as Objects in Glacier Deep Archive cannot be directly moved to another
storage class. These need to be restored first & then copied to the desired storage class. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as the Amazon S3 Glacier console can be used to access the vaults and
  objects
  in them. But it cannot be used to restore the objects. <br />

<p>A.
Amazon FSx for Lustre</p>
<p>B.
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</p>
<p>C.
Amazon EFS</p>
<p>D.

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Amazon FSx for Lustre is mainly used to do high-performance compute, read
  and
  write data into S3, and only works with Linux instances. more details: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/faqs/</a> <br />

- Option B is CORRECT. Amazon FSx works with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to integrate with your
  existing Windows environments. Users can use their existing AD-based user identities to
  authenticate
  themselves and access the Amazon FSx ﬁle system. More details: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/faqs/</a> <br />

- Option C is incorrect. EFS is an NFS storage system to work with Linux instances. More
  details: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/">https://aws.amazon.com/efs/</a> <br />

- Option D is incorrect. AD Connector is a directory gateway with which you can redirect directory
  requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory without caching any information in the
  cloud. Using S3 and AD Connector will not help in the given requirement. <br />

<p>You are part of the IT team of an insurance company. You have 4 M5.large EC2 instances used to
compute some data of your core services. The amount of usage of these instances has been very
consistent. So you predict that it will not increase in the next two or three years. However, your
CFO is asking if there is a way to reduce costs in the EC2 instances. What do you suggest to get the
maximum cost reduction?</p>
<p>A.
Use a Compute Savings Plan.</p>
<p>B.
Use an EC2 instance Savings Plan.</p>
<p>C.
Use a Convertible Reserved Instance.</p>
<p>D.

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Compute Saving plans also offer flexibility, but the maximum cost
  reduction is 66%. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because, with an EC2 saving plan, you can save up to 72% (just like Standard
  RIs). This plan applies to all of your EC2 instances using the same instance family. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because Convertible Reserved Instances provide a significant discount of up
  to
  66% compared to On-Demand Instances and can be purchased for a 1-year or 3-year term. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual
  private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. They cannot reduce the
  costs.

Correct Answer – C <br />

Amazon S3 is the perfect storage solution for audio and text files. It is a highly available and
durable storage device. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because storing files in EBS is not cost-efficient. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because files need to be retrieved frequently so Glacier is not
  suitable. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because instance store is not highly available compared with S3. <br />

Correct Answer - C <br />

Since the IT administrator needs to be provided SSH access to the instance, the traffic would be
inbound to the instance. <br />
Since Security groups are stateful, we do not have to configure outbound traffic. What enters the
inbound traffic is allowed in the outbound traffic too. <br />

Options A and B are incorrect because the default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to
flow in and out of the subnets to which it is associated. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because Security groups are stateful, we do not have to configure outbound
  traffic. <br />

Correct Answers: C and D <br />

- Option A is incorrect. DataSync is a service mainly used to migrate NFS servers to S3, EFS, Fsx,
  etc. It does not support database migrations. More details
  here: <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/faqs/</a> <br />
- Option B is incorrect because AWS Application Discovery Service helps plan cloud migration by
  gathering information about the on-premises data centers. <br />
- Option C is CORRECT. AWS Database Migration Service helps you to migrate your On-Premise database
  to
  AWS, keeping the On-Premise database fully operational during the migration. It also converts
  PL/SQL
  and SQL Server to MySQL or Postgres schemas with the help of the AWS Schema Conversion Tool
  included
  in this service. More
  details: <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/dms/faqs/</a> <br />
- Option D is CORRECT. AWS Migration Hub is used to track the progress of migrations in AWS. More
  details
  here <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/">https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/</a> <br />
- Option E is incorrect because AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is an automated
  lift-and-shift
  solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating to AWS. <br />

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - A <br />

With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website
clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications. Amazon
Kinesis enables you to process and analyze data as it arrives and responds instantly instead of
waiting until all your data is collected before the processing can begin. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the
  movement and transformation of data. There is no such requirement mentioned in the
  question. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media files that you have
  stored in Amazon S3 into media files in the formats required by consumer playback devices. For
  example, you can convert large, high-quality digital media files into formats that users can play
  back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions. <br />
  It is not suitable for the given requirement. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application
  components and helps to build applications in which messages are processed independently. There is
  no SQS-related requirement mentioned in the question. <br />

Correct Answer: A <br />

- Option A is correct. AWS Directory Service enables your end-users to use their existing corporate
  credentials while accessing AWS applications. Once you’ve been able to consolidate services to
  AWS,
  you won’t have to create new credentials. Instead, you’ll be able to allow the users to use their
  existing username/password. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. One Active Directory can be used for both on-premises and the cloud. This
  isn’t the best option provided. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. This won’t always reduce the number of username/password
  combinations. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. This requires more effort and additional management than using a managed
  service. <br />

    Explanation

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - C <br />

AWS documentation mentions the following: <br />

If you intend to keep your Amazon Redshift cluster running continuously for a prolonged period, you
should consider purchasing reserved node offerings. These offerings provide significant savings over
on-demand pricing, but they require you to reserve compute nodes and commit to paying for those
nodes for either a one-year or three-year duration. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because When you choose on-demand pricing, you can use the pause and resume
  feature to suspend on-demand billing when a cluster is not in use. Based on the requirement, we
  need
  steady-state workloads for 3 years which can be accomplished by Reserved instances. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because there is no requirement for backup in the question. We can use
  automated backup when everything has been set up on the instances (extra requirement). <br />

- Option D is incorrect because a cluster is required. An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a
  collection of computing resources called nodes, which are organized into a group called a
  cluster. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B <br />

AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving
data between storage systems and services. <br />

AWS DataSync doesn't support workflows where multiple active applications write to both locations at
the same time. DataSync can transfer files in opposite directions periodically. <br />

If a task is interrupted, for instance, or the network connection goes down or the AWS DataSync
agent is restarted, the next run of the task will transfer missing files. Each time a task is
started it performs an incremental copy, transferring only the changes from the source to the
destination. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Snowball devices are used to transfer a large set of data
  electronically, and do not meet the given requirements. <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because AWS Shield is a service to protect web applications against DDoS
  attacks. AWS WAF should be used in this scenario. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT because AWS provides the PHP protection rule in WAF. Users can add the rule in
  web ACL. <br />

<img src="/images/certificate/saa-c03/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4_img_3.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect because, in this scenario, you need to add the AWS managed PHP rule in web
  ACL. There is no need to use a rule offered by AWS Marketplace. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because there are no existing PHP-related actions inside the web ACL, so no
  rule's action can be overridden. It is suitable to add AWS managed PHP application rule. <br />

  in S3. Amazon Athena is serverless, and you are charged for the amount of scanned data. Besides,
  Athena can integrate with Amazon QuickSight that visualizes the data via dashboards. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because AWS Glue is an ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that
  organizes, cleanses, validates, and formats data in a data warehouse. This service is not required
  in this scenario. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because it is the same as Option B. AWS Glue is not required. <br />

  record. Route 53 is responsible for routing the traffic to the correct IP addresses. <br />
- Option D is CORRECT because Route 53 automatically routes the traffic to the new ELB IP addresses.
  With alias records, users do not need to change the record sets even if they have some
  configuration
  changes. <br />

Correct Answer – B and E <br />

Amazon CloudWatch will be used to monitor the IOPS metrics from the RDS Instance. Amazon Simple
Notification Service will be used to send the notification if an alarm is triggered. <br />

SES: <br />

It provides an email platform to send and receive emails using your own email addresses and
domains. <br />
It can also be used in place of any third-party email services. <br />
Using SNS with SES, you can segregate your emails based on categories like complaint-related emails,
positive feedback emails, and notifications regarding emails delivered or not. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com//blogs/messaging-and-targeting/">https://aws.amazon.com//blogs/messaging-and-targeting/</a> <br />

SQS: <br />

SQS is a queuing service, also used to decouple application components. For example, suppose there
is a data management application that receives a high volume of data writes during month-end. They
want to use AWS RDS. So they can use SQS before RDS to process the messages one by one or slow the
messages before sending them to the next AWS services (Lambda or Kinesis family). <br />
SQS will keep the data in the queue and then write the data into the RDS and the processing starts.
So, here the components are decoupled. Now not all the data coming together and reaching the next
services. <br />

SNS: <br />

Whenever there is a requirement of notification related to some failures or storage full and issues
like this, SNS can be used. CloudWatch and CloudTrail can handle the above failure and storage
metrics but that can only be visible in their console. So, Cloudwatch and CloudTrail can integrate
with SNS to enable notifications. <br />
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome-features.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome-features.html</a> <br />

- Option D is incorrect because Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name
  System (DNS) web service. It cannot be used to monitor metrics or send notifications. <br />

Recently, the database performance has been declining due to a high volume of read requests. Which
of the following can be added to the architecture to improve the database&rsquo;s performance? (Select
TWO)</p>
<p>A.
Add read replica to the primary database to offload read traffic.</p>
<p>B.
Use ElastiCache in front of the database.</p>
<p>C.
Use AWS CloudFront in front of the database.</p>
<p>D.

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer - A and B <br />

- Option A is correct because AWS says, "Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and
  durability for database (DB) instances. This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond
  the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can create
  one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic
  from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput" <br />

- Option B is correct because Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory cache that can be used to cache
  common read requests. <br />

The below diagram shows how caching can be added to an existing architecture: <br />

<img src="/images/certificate/saa-c03/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4_img_4.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option C is incorrect because CloudFront is a valuable component of scaling a website, especially
  for geo-location workloads and queries. This is more advanced for the given architecture. <br />

- Option D is incorrect because offloading data into DynamoDB is a time-consuming task. There is no
  requirement to offload the data into a tabular format. It is already provided to use Amazon
  RDS. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because server access logging does not trigger an SNS topic for the object
  removal events. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because you would need to write a custom Lambda function in the AWS Config

Correct Answer – D <br />

Available feature sets in AWS Organizations: <br />

All features – The default feature set that is available to AWS Organizations. It includes all the

Consolidated billing – This feature set provides shared billing functionality but does not include
the more advanced features of AWS Organizations. <br />

- Option A is incorrect: Because SCP is part of the advanced features which belong to “All

    Explanation
    </button>
  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address with which you can mask the
  failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your
  account. <br />
  If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with
  your instance to enable communication with the internet; for example, to connect to your instance
  from your local computer. <br />

From our problem statement, EC2 is launched with Auto-assign public IP enabled. So, since public IP
is available, Elastic IP is not necessary to connect from the internet. <br />

- Option C is incorrect because the problem statement clearly states that EC2 is launched with
  Auto-assign Public IP enabled, so this option cannot be true. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT as the NCL may not allow the ingress SSH traffic so the connection failed to
  connect. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because SSH uses port 22. A security group is stateful and in this scenario,
  the security group may disallow the ingress SSH traffic instead of egress. <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

Network Load Balancers and AWS PrivateLink work together to keep traffic within the AWS network,
ensuring it doesn't traverse the public internet. This is ideal for an internal application as it
enhances security. <br />

Network Load Balancers can handle high traffic volumes efficiently, making the solution scalable for
future growth. <br />

AWS PrivateLink creates a private connection between your VPC and the service endpoint, eliminating
exposure to the public internet. This strengthens the overall security posture. <br />

<img src="/images/certificate/saa-c03/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4_img_6.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4" loading="lazy"><br />

- Option A is incorrect. Using the Internet to establish connectivity between users & servers will
  not
  be a highly secure solution. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. VPC Gateway Endpoint service is for S3 and DynamoDB, which is unsuitable
  for
  this scenario. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as VPN connectivity between the instance of various VPCs will not be a
  scalable solution. <br />
  Accessing Services Through AWS Private Links: <br />

AWS PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that enables you to connect your VPC to
supported AWS services privately, services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC endpoint services), and
supported AWS Marketplace partner services. <br />

You do not require an internet gateway, NAT devices, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect
connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to communicate with the service. The traffic between
your VPC and the service does not leave the Amazon network. <br />

To use AWS PrivateLink, create an interface VPC endpoint for a service in your VPC. This creates an
elastic network interface in your subnet with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for
the traffic, destined for the service. For more information, see VPC Endpoints. <br />

AWS License Manager indeed enables organizations to track both AWS-provided licenses and custom
licenses procured independently. It provides visibility into license usage, helps in controlling
usage to ensure compliance with licensing terms, and offers features like License Manager rules to
set up licensing rules. <br />

- Option B is incorrect because AWS License Manager supports tracking licenses for both AWS-provided
  and third-party software, not just AWS-provided software. While it does support tracking
  AWS-provided services like Amazon RDS and Amazon EC2 instances, it's not limited to them. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because AWS License Manager does offer integration with leading software
  vendors for managing third-party software licenses, it's not primarily designed for third-party
  software. It equally supports AWS-provided licenses and custom licenses. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because AWS License Manager does not automatically purchase or allocate
  additional licenses when usage exceeds predefined thresholds. It provides visibility into license
  usage and helps enforce compliance <br />

Answer: B <br />

- Option A is incorrect because there is a way to achieve encryption afterward which is given in
  option B. <br />
- Option B is CORRECT. You can enable encryption for an RDS DB instance when you create it, but not
  after it's created. However, you can add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance by creating a
  snapshot of your DB instance and then creating an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then
  restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot to get an encrypted copy of your original DB
  instance. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because we have to copy and encrypt the snapshot first. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because the currently running un-encrypted DB instance cannot be
  encrypted. <br />

  records that will be synced within 60 seconds. <br />

- Option B is incorrect. If you stop and start your instance, the Elastic IP address is still
  associated with the instance. To retain a public IPv4 address that never changes, you can
  associate
  an Elastic IP address with your instance. The issue has happened means there is no Elastic IP
  attached. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. If you stop and start your instance, the new public IP address gets
  attached
  to ENI, no need to manually associate it. Each instance has a default network interface, called
  the
  primary network interface eth0. You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance.
  You
  can create and attach additional network interfaces. But the previous IP is changed due to stop
  and
  start, hence access issues will occur. <br />

- Option D is correct. By default, the public IP address of an EC2 Instance is released after the
  instance is stopped and started. Hence, the earlier IP address which was mapped to the domain
  names
  would have become invalid now.

AWS Documentation mentions the following about these services: <br />

- Option A is correct as Amazon CloudWatch Logs is used to monitor, store, and access your log files
  from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Route 53, and
  other
  sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/</a> <br />

- Option B is incorrect because AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and guidance for AWS
  events that might affect your environment. It will not help to monitor the web application. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/personal-health-dashboard/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/personal-health-dashboard/</a> <br />

- Option C is incorrect because AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you with
  real-time
  guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. It is not required as
  per the requirement. The question asks for monitoring services, not logging or some visualizing
  service. <br />

- Option D is incorrect as AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance,
  operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. CloudTrail logs focus on the AWS
  account or API logs which include actions taken through the AWS services, AWS Management Console,
  AWS SDKs, and command line tools. <br />

Whereas CloudWatch logs focus on application logs like logging the events for a particular
application. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – B <br />

An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance
to accelerate High-Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. <br />

- Option A is incorrect, Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet-per-second (
  PPS)
  performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. It uses the Elastic Network
  Adapter (
  ENA) or Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface, which can significantly improve network
  performance. However, while it enhances network performance, it doesn’t match the low-latency,
  high-throughput capabilities of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). <br />

- Option C is incorrect, An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a logical networking component that
  can
  be attached to an instance. While it allows for flexible network configurations and can be used to
  manage network traffic, it doesn’t inherently provide the same level of performance enhancement as
  EFA or even enhanced networking with ENA. <br />

- Option D is incorrect: Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for Amazon EC2, and cannot be
  used
  for improving the performance of HPC and machine learning applications. <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following on Amazon Kinesis: <br />

Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can
get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Amazon Kinesis offers key capabilities to
cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale, along with the flexibility to choose the tools
that best suit the requirements of your application. With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time
data such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for
machine learning, analytics, and other applications. <br />

For more information on Amazon Kinesis, please refer to the below URL: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Amazon EMR can be used to process applications with data-intensive
  workloads
  but is not a data streaming service. <br />
- Option B is correct. Amazon Kinesis can be used to store, process, and analyze real-time streaming
  data. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. SQS is a fully managed message queuing service. But it cannot be configured
  as a real-time data streaming service. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. SNS is a flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications
  service instead of a data streaming service. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

Create Alarms That Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an Instance <br />

Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate,
reboot, or recover your instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions to save money when you
no longer need an instance. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those
instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs. <br />

There are several scenarios in which you might want to stop or terminate your instance
automatically. For example, you might have instances dedicated to batch payroll processing jobs or
scientific computing tasks that run for a period of time and then complete their work. Rather than
letting those instances sit idle (and accrue charges), you can stop or terminate them, helping you
to save money. The main difference between using the stop and the terminate alarm actions is that
you can easily restart a stopped instance if you need to rerun it later, and you can keep the same
instance ID and root volume. However, you cannot restart a terminated instance. Instead, you must
launch a new instance. <br />

You can add the stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions to any alarm that is set on an Amazon
EC2 per-instance metric, including basic and detailed monitoring metrics provided by Amazon
CloudWatch (in the AWS/EC2 namespace), as well as any custom metrics that include the InstanceId
dimension, as long as its value refers to a valid running Amazon EC2 instance. <br />

For more information on Amazon EC2, please
visit <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/UsingAlarmActions.html#AddingStopActions">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/UsingAlarmActions.html#AddingStopActions.</a> <br />

Breakdown <br />

- Option A is incorrect because CloudWatch Logs is not suitable to monitor the CloudWatch
  Metrics. <br />
- Option B is correct. CloudWatch alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric. Alarms
  can
  trigger auto-scaling, EC2 actions(stop, terminate, recover, or reboot) and SNS
  notifications. <br />
- Option C is incorrect because SQS cannot modify the EC2 state when a CloudWatch metric breaches a
  threshold value. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because AWS Lambda is not necessary in this scenario. CloudWatch Alarms can
  directly monitor the metric and trigger actions when needed. <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

The NAT Gateway is an ideal option to ensure that instances in the private subnet have the ability
to download updates from the Internet. <br />

For more information on the NAT Gateway, please refer to the below URL: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect because there may be a security reason for keeping these instances in the
  private subnet such as for DB instances. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. The instances in the private subnet may be running various applications and
  DB instances. Hence, it is not advisable or practical for an EC2 Instance to download the updates
  separately and then push them to the required instance. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because a VPC link is not used to connect to the Internet.

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer – A <br />

In this scenario, the SQS queue is used to store the object details, which is a highly scalable and
reliable service. ECS is ideal for performing batch processing, and it should scale up or down based
on the number of messages in the queue. <br />

If you use a target tracking scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric, dynamic
scaling can adjust to the demand curve of your application more effectively. <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: Users can configure a CloudWatch alarm based on the number of messages in the
  SQS queue and notify the ECS cluster to scale up or down using the alarm. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because the memory usage may not be able to reflect the workload. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because the number of objects in S3 cannot determine if the ECS cluster
  should change its capacity. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because the number of containers cannot be used as a metric to trigger an
  auto-scaling event. <br />

An Auto Scaling group to manage EC2 instances for the purposes of processing messages from an SQS
queue. <br />

A custom metric to send to Amazon CloudWatch that measures the number of messages in the queue per
EC2 instance in the Auto Scaling group. <br />

A target tracking policy that configures your Auto Scaling group to scale based on the custom metric
and a set target value. CloudWatch alarms invoke the scaling policy. <br />

Correct Answer: B <br />

AWS documentation mentions the following: <br />

While configuring this setup, you’ll place a private VPC endpoint in your VPC that connects to the
DataSync service. This endpoint will be used for communication between your agent and the DataSync
service. <br />
In addition, for each transfer task, four elastic network interfaces (ENIs) will automatically get
placed in your VPC. DataSync agent will send traffic through these ENIs in order to transfer data
from your on-premises shares into AWS. <br />
"When you use DataSync with a private VPC endpoint, the DataSync agent can communicate directly with
AWS without the need to cross the public internet." <br />

- Option A is incorrect. To ensure your data isn’t sent over the public internet, you need to use a
  VPC endpoint to connect the DataSync agent to the DataSync service endpoints. <br />
- Option B is correct. Using a private VPC endpoint and the private DataSync service endpoints keeps
  your data from traveling over the public internet. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. Using the Internet Gateway by definition sends your traffic over the public
  internet, which is the solution as per the requirement. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. Using a public VPC endpoint and the DataSync service endpoints to
  communicate
  over your VPN will have the traffic traveling over the internet. <br />

Correct Answer – C and D <br />

When you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with a Lambda function
that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the
table's stream. AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it
detects new stream records. Since we require an immediate entry made to an application in case an
item in the DynamoDB table is modified, a lambda function is also required. <br />

Consider a mobile gaming app that writes to a GamesScores table. Whenever the top score of the Game
Scores table is updated, a corresponding stream record is written to the table's stream. This event
could trigger a Lambda function that posts a Congratulatory message on a Social media network
handle. <br />

DynamoDB streams can be used to monitor the changes to a DynamoDB table. <br />

A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in an Amazon DynamoDB
table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification
to data items in the table. <br />

Note: <br />
DynamoDB is integrated with Lambda so that you can create triggers for events in DynamoDB
Streams. <br />

If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with a Lambda function
that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the
table's stream. <br />

AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function synchronously when it detects new
stream records. Since our requirement states that an item modified in a DynamoDB table causes an
immediate entry to an associating application, a lambda function is also required. <br />

Options A and B are incorrect because CloudWatch or CloudWatch logs cannot be used to monitor any
item changes in a DynamoDB table. <br />

restore the Database to any specific time during the backup retention period in Amazon RDS. Which of
the following actions are performed as a part of the Amazon RDS automated backup process?</p>
<p>A.
AWS creates a storage volume snapshot of the database instance during the backup window once a day.
AWS RDS also captures transactions logs and uploads them to S3 buckets every 5 minutes.</p>
<p>B.
AWS creates a full snapshot of the database every 12 hours during the backup window, captures
transactions logs throughout the day, and stores them in S3 buckets.</p>
<p>C.
AWS creates a full daily snapshot during the backup window. With the snapshot, the RDS instance can
be restored at any time.</p>
<p>D.
AWS creates a storage volume snapshot of the database instance every 12 hours during the backup
window, captures transactions logs throughout the day, and stores them in S3 buckets.</p>

Correct Answer – A <br />

During automated backup, Amazon RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of the entire Database
Instance. RDS uploads transaction logs for DB instances to Amazon S3 every 5 minutes. To restore a
DB instance at a specific point in time, a new DB instance is created using the DB snapshot. <br />

You can also use AWS Backup to manage backups of Amazon RDS DB instances. If your DB instance is
associated with a backup plan in AWS Backup, that backup plan is used for point-in-time
recovery. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as RDS automated backup does not take a full snapshot every 12 hours. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as this option does not mention the transaction logs captured in the
  automated
  backup process. - Option A is more accurate. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as AWS performs storage volume snapshots daily, not every 12 hours. <br />

  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: B, C <br />

For Option A, for any route table, the local route cannot be edited or deleted. <br />
AWS Docs says: <br />

"Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC over IPv4. If your VPC
has more than one IPv4 CIDR block, your route tables contain a local route for each IPv4 CIDR block.
If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, your route tables contain a local route for
the IPv6 CIDR block. You cannot modify or delete these routes." <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#RouteTables">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#RouteTables</a> <br />

For Option B, possible because the security group is configured with a public subnet IP range
instead of a private subnet 1 IP range, and EC2 is in private subnet 1. So EC2 will not be able to
communicate with RDS in private subnet 2. <br />

- Option C is correct. <br />

- Option D is not correct because Security Groups are stateful. If you send a request from your
  instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound
  security
  group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound
  rules. <br />

<p>As a Solutions Architect for a multinational organization with more than 150000 employees,
management has decided to implement a real-time analysis for their employees&rsquo; time spent in offices
worldwide. You are tasked to design an architecture that will receive the inputs from 10000+ sensors
with swipe machine sending in and out data across the globe, each sending 20KB data every 5 Seconds
in JSON format. The application will process and analyze the data and upload the results to
dashboards in real-time.</p>
<p>Other application requirements will include the ability to apply real-time analytics on the captured
data. Processing of captured data will be parallel and durable. The application must be scalable as
per the requirement as the load varies and new sensors are added or removed at various facilities.
The analytic processing results are stored in a persistent data storage for data mining.</p>
<p>What combination of AWS services would be used for the above scenario?</p>
<p>A.
Use EMR to copy the data coming from Swipe machines into DynamoDB and make it available for
analytics.</p>
<p>B.
Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the Swipe data coming from sensors, Use custom Kinesis
Data Streams Applications to analyze the data and then move analytics outcomes to RedShift using AWS
EMR.</p>
<p>C.
Use SQS to receive the data coming from sensors, Kinesis Firehose to analyze the data from SQS, then
save the results to a Multi-AZ RDS instance.</p>

Correct Answer - B <br />

- Option A is incorrect. EMR is not for receiving real-time data from thousands of sources. EMR is
  mainly used for Hadoop ecosystem-based data used for Big data analysis. <br />

- Option B is correct as the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams are used to read the data from thousands of
  sources like social media, survey-based data, etc. The Kinesis Data Streams can be used to analyze
  the data and feed it using AWS EMR to the analytics-based database like RedShift which works on
  OLAP. <br />

- Option C is incorrect. SQS cannot be used to read real-time data from thousands of sources. The
  Kinesis Firehose is used to ship the data to other AWS services, not for analysis. And finally,
  RDS
  is again an OLTP based database. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as the AWS EMR can read large amounts of data. However, RDS is a
  transactional
  database that works based on the OLTP. Thus, it cannot store the analytical data. <br />

This option addresses the issue by ensuring that the server certificate and client certificate are
issued by a trusted CA, which is a requirement for certificates used with AWS Client VPN endpoints.
Re-importing them into ACM ensures proper validation and trust. <br />

- Option A is incorrect because Configuring the VPN endpoint to accept self-signed certificates
  bypasses security best practices and introduces potential security risks. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because While adjusting encryption settings might be necessary for
  compatibility, it does not directly address the issue of certificate import failure. <br />
- Option D is incorrect because Disabling certificate validation compromises the security of the VPN
  connection and does not address the underlying issue of certificate import failure <br />

Correct Answer – B <br />

The S3 bucket owner can create Pre-Signed URLs to upload the images to S3. <br />

For more information on Pre-Signed URLs, please refer to the URL below. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Amazon has provided us with an inbuilt function for this requirement. This
  option is expensive and time-consuming. As a Solution Architect, you are supposed to pick the best
  and cost-effective solution. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. ECS is a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it
  easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange
  messages through a polling model and not through a push mechanism. <br />

Note: <br />

This question is based on the scenario where we can use the pre-signed URL. <br />

You need to understand about pre-signed URL - which contains the user login credentials particular
resources, such as S3 in this scenario. And user must have the permission enabled that other
applications can use the credential to upload the data (images) in S3 buckets. <br />

AWS Definition: <br />

"A pre-signed URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of
the pre-signed URL has permissions to access that object. That is, if you receive a pre-signed URL
to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the pre-signed URL has the
necessary permissions to upload that object. <br />

All objects and buckets by default are private. The pre-signed URLs are useful if you want your
user/customer to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS
security credentials or permissions. When you create a pre-signed URL, you must provide your
security credentials and then specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method (PUT for
uploading objects), and an expiration date and time. The pre-signed URLs are valid only for the
specified duration."

Correct Answer – D <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without
worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces
management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and
Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing,
scaling, and application health monitoring. <br />

For more information on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, please refer to the URL below. <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect. Amazon EC2 Spot instances are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud
  available to you at steep discounts compared to On-Demand prices. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. A Reserved Instance is a reservation of resources and capacity for either
  one
  or three years for a particular Availability Zone within a region. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. AWS Lambda is a compute service that makes it easy for you to build
  applications that respond quickly to new information and not for provisioning a new
  environment. <br />

Currently, the Elastic Beanstalk environment supports the following configurations: <br />

<img src="/images/certificate/saa-c03/saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4_img_11.png" alt="saa-c03-exam-practice-questions-part-4" loading="lazy"><br />

It supports RDS. <br />

Database Configuration Setting <br />

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides connection information to your instances by setting environment
properties for the database hostname, username, password, table name, and port. When you add a
database to your environment, its lifecycle is tied to your environments. <br />

<p>Third-party sign-in (Federation) has been implemented in your web application to allow users who
need access to AWS resources. Users have been successfully logging in using Google, Facebook, and
other third-party credentials. Suddenly, their access to some AWS resources has been restricted.
What is the most likely cause of the restricted use of AWS resources?</p>
<p>A.
IAM policies for resources were changed, thereby restricting access to AWS resources.</p>
<p>B.
Federation protocols are used to authorize services and need to be updated.</p>
<p>C.
IAM groups for accessing the AWS resources were changed, thereby restricting their access via

  </p>
  <div class="toggle-content" style="display: none;">
    
Correct Answer: A <br />

Users of your app can sign in using a well-known external identity provider (IdP), such as Login
with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP. They can receive
an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that
map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. <br />

- Option A is correct. When IAM policies are changed, they can impact the user experience and
  services
  they can connect to. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. Federation is used to authenticate users, not to authorize services. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. "IAM groups for accessing the AWS resources" is NOT the correct usage, as
  IAM
  role(s) must be attached. <br />
- Option D is incorrect. The identity providers don’t have the capability to authorize services;
  they
  authenticate users. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

Existing unencrypted RDS instances and their snapshots cannot be encrypted. Users can only enable
encryption for an RDS DB instance when they create it. The limitations can be found in the AWS
documentation
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html</a> <br />

- Option A is CORRECT: Because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot. Then the new
  RDS
  instance launched from the snapshot and the Read Replica of the new DB instance are
  encrypted. <br />
- Option B is incorrect: Because you cannot encrypt an unencrypted RDS instance directly. <br />
- Option C is incorrect: Because you cannot encrypt an unencrypted DB snapshot directly according to
  the above reference. You should create a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot and then encrypt the
  new
  snapshot. <br />
- Option D is incorrect: Because an unencrypted DB Read Replica cannot be encrypted. The correct
  method is to launch a new instance from an encrypted DB snapshot. <br />

Amazon DynamoDB global tables provide a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-Region,
multi-active database, without having to build and maintain your own replication solution. <br />
Global tables provide automatic multi-active replication to AWS Regions worldwide. They enable you

- Option A is incorrect since CloudFront should ideally be used in front of web distributions.
  DynamoDB already has a feature to provide low latency. <br />
- Option B is incorrect since there is no such feature of Multi-AZ in DynamoDB. <br />
- Option C is incorrect since ElastiCache would not be effective for multiple regions <br />

Correct Answer – C <br />

With AWS Resource Access Manager, you can share resources that you own with other individual AWS
accounts. If your account is managed by AWS Organizations, you can also share resources with the
other accounts in your organization. You can also use resources that were shared with you by other
AWS accounts. <br />

If you don't enable sharing within AWS Organizations, you can't share resources with your
organization or with the organizational units (OU) in your organization. However, you can still
share resources with individual AWS accounts in your organization. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as removing both accounts from AWS Organization for Resource sharing is not
  a
  valid option. <br />
- Option B is incorrect because when sharing is not enabled in the Organization, resources are not
  automatically shared. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as removing a destination account from AWS Organization is not required for
  resource sharing. <br />

Correct Answer - A <br />

Volume Gateways and Cached Volumes can be used to start storing data in S3. <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

You store your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of frequently
accessed data subsets locally. Cached volumes offer substantial cost savings on primary storage and
minimize the need to scale your storage on-premises. You also retain low-latency access to your
frequently accessed data. <br />

This is the difference between Cached and stored volumes: <br />

Cached volumes – You store your data in S3 and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets
locally. Cached volumes offer substantial cost savings on primary storage and "minimize the need to
scale your storage on-premises. You also retain low-latency access to your frequently accessed
data." <br />

Stored volumes – If you need low-latency access to your entire data set, first configure your
on-premises gateway to store all your data locally. Then asynchronously back up point-in-time
snapshots of this data to Amazon S3. "This configuration provides durable and inexpensive off-site
backups that you can recover to your local data center or Amazon EC2." For example, if you need
replacement capacity for disaster recovery, you can recover the backups to Amazon EC2. <br />

As described in the answer: The company wants a quick win solution to store data with AWS, avoiding
scaling the on-premise setup rather than backing up the data. <br />

In the question, they mentioned that "A company has a lot of data hosted on their On-premises
infrastructure." From On-premises to cloud infrastructure, you can use AWS storage gateways. <br />

Options C and D are incorrect as they are talking about the S3 storage classes, but the requirement
is (How) to transfer or migrate your data from On-premises to Cloud infrastructure. <br />

Correct Answer – A <br />

Legacy database refers to a database that has been in use for many years and is unsuitable for
modern apps and environments. <br />

In this case, the Legacy Database will be converted to Amazon DynamoDB, which will be a heterogenous
conversion. Using AWS Schema Conversion Tool is best suited for such conversion along with AWS DMS
to transfer data from on-premise to AWS. <br />
Using the Amazon S3 bucket will help to save any amount of data most cost-effectively before
uploading the data to Amazon DynamoDB. <br />

- Option B is incorrect as the engine conversion tool is best suited for homogeneous database
  migration. In this case, it's a heterogeneous database. So using AWS SCT along with AWS DMS is the
  best option. <br />
  Options C and D are incorrect as using the Amazon S3 bucket is a more cost-effective option than
  using the Amazon EC2 instance. <br />

<h4 id="question-61">Question 61</h4>
<p>A Financial firm is planning to build a highly resilient application with primary database servers
located at on-premises data centers while maintaining its DB snapshots in an S3 bucket. The IT Team
is looking for a cost-effective and secure way of transferring the large customer financial
databases from on-premises servers to the Amazon S3 bucket with no impact on the client usage of
these applications. Also, post this data transfer, the on-premises application will be fetching data
from the Amazon S3 bucket in case of a primary database failure.</p>
<p>So, your solution should ensure that the Amazon S3 data is fully synced with the on-premises
database. Which of the following can be used to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>A.
Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration for transferring data between the on-premises &amp; Amazon S3 bucket
while using AWS Data Sync for accessing these S3 bucket data from the on-premises application.</p>
<p>B.
Use AWS Data Sync for transferring data between the on-premises &amp; Amazon S3 bucket while using AWS
Storage Gateway for accessing these S3 bucket data from the on-premises application.</p>
<p>C.
Use AWS Snowball Edge for transferring data between the on-premises &amp; Amazon S3 bucket while using
AWS Storage Gateway for accessing these S3 bucket data from the on-premises application.</p>
<p>D.
Use AWS Transfer for transferring data between the on-premises &amp; Amazon S3 bucket while using AWS

Correct Answer – B <br />

AWS DataSync can be used for huge amounts of data transfer between on-premises & AWS. AWS Data Sync
is a secure way of online data transfer. Once data is transferred to the AWS S3 bucket, AWS Storage
Gateway can have data synced between on-premises servers & AWS S3 buckets. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can be used for applications that have
  already integrated with Amazon S3 API. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as AWS Snowball Edge can be used for offline data transfer between
  on-premises & AWS S3 bucket. <br />
- Option D is incorrect as AWS Transfer is a better choice for transferring SFTP data between
  on-premises & Amazon S3. <br />

Correct Answer - D <br />

AWS Documentation mentions the following: <br />

If your workload is mainly sending GET requests, in addition to the preceding guidelines, you should
consider using Amazon CloudFront for performance optimization. <br />

Integrating Amazon CloudFront with Amazon S3, you can distribute content to your users with low
latency and a high data transfer rate. You will also send fewer direct requests to Amazon S3, which
will reduce your costs. <br />

For example, suppose that you have a few very popular objects. Amazon CloudFront fetches those
objects from Amazon S3 and caches them. Amazon CloudFront can then serve future requests for the
objects from its cache, reducing the number of GET requests it sends to Amazon S3. <br />

For more information on performance considerations in S3, please visit the following URL: <br />

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html</a> <br />

- Option A is incorrect. S3 Cross-Region Replication is not the correct answer for this business
  scenario. You are asked how to provide easier & faster access to data in the S3 bucket, and this
  option is used to replicate S3 bucket data across regions. <br />
- Option B is incorrect. S3 TA is used for fast, easy, and secure file transfer over long distances
  between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket. S3 Transfer Acceleration does leverage Amazon
  CloudFront’s globally distributed AWS Edge Locations. But it would be too costly for this
  situation. <br />
- Option C is incorrect. ELB is used to distribute traffic on to EC2 Instances. <br />

Correct Answer – D <br />

Using AWS VPN is the fastest & cost-effective way of establishing IPSEC connectivity from on-premise
to AWS. IT teams can quickly set up a VPN connection with VGW in the US-east-1 region so that
internal users can seamlessly connect to resources hosted on AWS. <br />

- Option A is incorrect as AWS Direct Connect does not provide IPSEC connectivity. It is not a quick
  way to establish connectivity. <br />
- Option B is incorrect as you need to look for a third party solution from AWS Marketplace. And it
  may not be as cost-efficient as option D. <br />
- Option C is incorrect as although this will provide a high performance secure IPSEC connectivity
  from On-premise to AWS, it is not a quick way to establish connectivity. It may take weeks or
  months
  to configure the AWS Direct Connect connection. AWS Direct Connect is also not
  cost-effective. <br />

Answer: C <br />

A CNAME record maps one domain name to another (e.g., <br />
<pre><code>www.example-bucket.com</code></pre>
to
<pre><code>example-bucket.com.s3-website-us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code></pre>
). This is the appropriate choice for routing traffic to an S3 website endpoint when using a custom
domain. <br />

- Option A is incorrect An A record maps a domain to an IPv4 address, but S3 website endpoints do
  not
  have static IP addresses. They are accessed through DNS names, making this option unsuitable for
  routing traffic to an S3 website endpoint. <br />

- Option B is incorrect While an A record with an alias can route traffic to AWS resources like S3
  buckets, alias records cannot be used with S3 website endpoints. They are only applicable for S3
  buckets configured as static website hosting without a custom domain. <br />

- Option D is incorrect Route 53 does not support an alias for CNAME records. Alias records are only
  available for A and AAAA record types, not for CNAME. <br />
